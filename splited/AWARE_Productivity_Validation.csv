I wish the app would stick to a hierarchical filing system instead of useless (to me) divider system. And most of all, the recording feature is great but the playback and scrolling suuuuuucks. There should also be a skip forward button and the skip time settings should be customizable.

It’s taken a bit of adjustment in my workflow, but I’m loving it. It is faster, more reliable, and offers some other advantages as well, like the option to save a webpage as one long PDF, which brilliantly solves multiple problems Evernote has always had with saving webpages.

If there are slides in a powerpoint that I don’t have I want to be able to take a picture quickly and have it come out in decent quality. OneNote has that amazing feature where as you take a photo of a slide, it automatically is able to resize and realign the photo so that it’s not all crooked.

Having some free/blank space on the side where I can make additional notes so that I don’t have to write on my powerpoint slides. Sometimes the slides have too much material and it feels clustered to have to squeeze my notes onto it so it would be awesome if I could have space on the side to add notes.

I rely on it to organize notes and recipes, and also to track bookmarked articles that I want to reference later. The most recent iOS update has made the app completely unusable. Every action is painfully slow. It crashes often. And then when I finally get a note open (like a recipe, for example), if I switch between Evernote and another app, then Evernote completely restarts and I lose my place and have to search for the note again. This happens even if I switch apps for less then a minute. On top of that, I use Evernote primarily to bookmark webpages, not to clip them. When I open up a note, it’s unclear how to force the app to take me to the original webpage. Sometimes if I tap the note to edit it, Evernote launches its embedded browser (which is ridiculously slow). But other times when I tap the note, it goes into editing mode and there aren’t any options to navigate to the original webpage. I use Evernote to reference recipes several times a week, and I had to stop using my phone for that task. Instead, I search for the recipe using Google on my laptop because it’s faster.

The result, now that the month’s experiment has concluded, is that I’m switching back to the other app. Leaving aside all the countless comparisons and contrasts between these two apps, the deal breaker for me was that Notability’s syncing between iPhone, iPad, and Mac is awful. Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst—I would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from. The only way to finally get some files to sync was to delete the Notability app and reinstall it, and even then it was only successful some of the time. As you might imagine, that workaround was beyond disappointing—it was incredibly inconvenient and completely untenable.Don’t get me wrong: Notability is still a very worthwhile purchase.

There are a lot of note taking apps on the market. I feel like if you want a quality one, maybe you need to pay for it. So, I purchased this one and Good Notes. I’ve used Evernote and Microsoft OneNote as well. Nothing sets this apart from competitors besides the price. And please beware: that price for the iOS app does not include the desktop app. That’s a separate charge. You can’t access it through a browser either. That’s a huge negative in my opinion. Additionally, sometimes this app will crash (like during iOS updates) and you’ll lose your subjects and dividers. So, there’s a way to get your subjects back, but you’re out of luck with your dividers. What does this mean? It means that all of the classes you’ve set up for multiple semesters will be wiped out. Whatever was organized under is able to be obtained, but you have to go back through and sort all of it. Do you know what an incredibly awful and tedious task that is? When you contact their customer service, they’re basically just like “Oh, sorryyyyy yeah we don’t care.” If you’re still reading this, oh hey. One last final note: don’t waste your money. I’ve tried them all and think Microsoft OneNote is really the way to go. It’s free, you get cloud storage, the app on the computer is free, and you get full functionality of program.

The second thing is about the page loading steps or speed. By moving down the scroll bar the pages are loaded incrementally. But it has too many steps to the bottom page. Scrolling down the bar to the bottom of the screen loads pages a little. I couldn’t find a good way to jump to the bottom page at once. And this happens in Mobile view. The third frustrating thing is the reaction speed is not just slow, it’s really slow. When I type a character, say A, that appears in the screen after about 0.3~0.5s.

I could store information that I needed to reference later, etc. However it is not what I consider to be a well rounded app. As no app that makes you have to use another is considered all that great. Not being able to create reoccurring reminders is just ridiculous. This is a very basic feature for a task app to have. I simply stopped using the app altogether because I had to use other sources to make tasks and be reminded of especially when they are monthly or weekly repeating. I even periodically login just to see if this feature has been added, it hasn’t. The app really needs updated to meet this basic need, and no emailing repeating tasks to the user is not sufficient at all. As not every one is on their email constantly some only check certain times a day based on their schedules. The whole point of having an app that features task or to do items is to have push notifications for you to get reminded of the task or even projects you need to get done.

The bugs don’t get fixed and tend to get worse. Notability frequently freezes with the magnifier circle on an area you just highlighted/underlined/marked. You just have to tap the screen with your pencil to unfreeze it, but if you change from highlighter to pen, or vice versa, tapping causes whatever you just highlighted into pen. It was a small annoyance before, but it is happening more and more frequently. Notability likes to lose notes. Many of my peers have problems with this. I lost a weeks worth of notes from notability. Thankfully, I back up to google drive and iCloud. It was present in google drive, but not iCloud. The previous review stands. The problem occurs when people download the iOS app and causes malfunction on the iPad and computer. It is not due to low storage space, as there is plenty of storage space available. Basically, you have to deal with it until it magically stops...or doesn’t. Why keep using notability? Best we have, so we deal with the bugs. Previous review: Please fix the iCloud sync bug. The app decides to sync all my notes in the middle of class, preventing me from taking notes while the sync is happening. It is also duplicating many notes.

Also, the ability to tag how I spend my time (ex: work vs all other things) is an easy way to stay balanced.

Fortunately for Evernote, this app’s function worked better than any other notes app when I first downloaded it a couple years ago. Unfortunately, the inertia of having so many notes kept me with Evernote long after it decided to add a premium subscription and slowly but surely take away all of the nice features that made it better than its competitors. Frankly, I’m a simple user- I write notes and categorize them, and here’s the thing: after getting a new iPad, I decided to give the Apple native notes a try, and it was just better. Evernote had for a while started to feel like I was constantly hitting the paywall by having only the free version and every time I opened it I was hounded by reminders of how much more I could be doing if I would only PAY for its services. But notes’ interface is sleeker, syncs on all THREE of my devices (yes, agreed, excessive, but if I’ve got ‘em, I want ‘em to sync!!), searches just fine, and is just as easy to use.I finally decided to switch over- and if you’re slowly getting tired of Evernote, you should think about it too :)","But notes’ interface is sleeker, syncs on all THREE of my devices (yes, agreed, excessive, but if I’ve got ‘em, I want ‘em to sync!!",3,True,effectiveness,interface,12.0,21.0,positive,2

For example I use Evernote to store all my recipes, and while I’m cooking I’ll have the note with the recipe open, and then if I switch to my web browser to look up something, or my phone screen turns off, Evernote closes the note and it goes back to the main screen where all your notes are. This is super tedious and frustrating because then instead of looking at my phone to see what’s next in the recipe, I have to go back and search for the recipe again. It seems like a minor thing, but I think it’s pretty basic and should be addressed. If my phone was off for a long period of time I wouldn’t expect the note to stay open, but it’s always a matter of minutes if not less than a minute.","A while back they limited the free version to just two devices, so I dropped the iPad for my phone and laptop.",4,True,general,free version,31.0,43.0,negative,4

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the “Shapes Detection” option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn’t automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

They’ve recently updated the software and not only has it forced me to upgrade my membership with them because they only allow 2 devices, not 3 (like they had been doing up to now), but it has also completely slowed down the app. I’ve never had problems with the application lagging, but it seems that they’ve tried to connect the app to too many things that only power users (like me) might use. The result is that it’s constantly lagging and in many cases, not syncing or even loading. I’ve just written notes from a 2 hour management meeting which were completely lost because my iPad sleep screen went up and upon awaking my iPad, everything was lost!

It’s unique recording feature is perfect for lecture notes, and so I decided to give it a full month test, switching from another very well known note taking app and using Notability exclusively. The result, now that the month’s experiment has concluded, is that I’m switching back to the other app. Leaving aside all the countless comparisons and contrasts between these two apps, the deal breaker for me was that Notability’s syncing between iPhone, iPad, and Mac is awful. Any imported big file would only sync to one device, never appearing on all three. PDF imports were the worst—I would check literally DAYS later for a given pdf file to appear on ALL of my devices, only to have it stuck on the one device I originally imported it from. The only way to finally get some files to sync was to delete the Notability app and reinstall it, and even then it was only successful some of the time. As you might imagine, that workaround was beyond disappointing—it was incredibly inconvenient and completely untenable.Don’t get me wrong: Notability is still a very worthwhile purchase. There’s a lot to like about the features and its ease of use, and I’ll definitely be keeping it as my backup. And I’ll still use it whenever I need to combine note taking with recordings.

Scan function frequently  recognizes only part of a page, meaning multiple rescans necessary.  Marking up any documents takes 3x as long due to seconds wasted every time you need to translate from one tool to another.  All elements of marking up are glitchy - text box doesn’t always appear, no erase function (just delete entire edit), stylus writing is clunky, etc.  There is no way I can use this as a substitute for paper copy and hand marking.

You’ll find, though, that once you save your document and view it through anywhere but the Word app, half of the images are suddenly sideways, a few are upside down, and two of them have managed to migrate above the title of your document. The first two of those issues are likely due to the fact that the rotate image feature isn’t functional, but the second one? No idea. Besides all that, the app is incredibly glitchy and likes to do strange things when you accidentally tap the screen. The layout is weird and the UI is broken.

But we were promised the same functionality, so what the hell, I guess I’ll give it a try. Well, let me tell you, I’m beyond disappointed.For starters, Inbox would organize all emails into neat categories: Promotions, Purchases, important stuff, and what not. Everything other than important stuff didn’t trigger a notification which is fine by me because I get a ton of spam. It was easier to clean up too.Next, visually Inbox was far better organized. Emails had visual cues, reminders and things related to your calendar had a different layout, etc. Again, it made your inbox easier to organize.There was also the “Done” functionality. Essentially it meant that with one click you could make an email disappear from the main view but it wasn’t deleted. Just moved somewhere else.None of that exists for Gmail. Quite frankly, Gmail hasn’t changed since it was released (visual, layout, etc). I’m not one for fix what ain’t broken but for the love of god, could we step into the 21st century?

And please beware: that price for the iOS app does not include the desktop app. That’s a separate charge. You can’t access it through a browser either. That’s a huge negative in my opinion.

So, there’s a way to get your subjects back, but you’re out of luck with your dividers. What does this mean? It means that all of the classes you’ve set up for multiple semesters will be wiped out.

Additionally, the app “reloads” the page every time I switch away or lock/unlock the phone, which makes entering or editing notes incredibly painstaking. I use Evernote on two devices and occasionally access the web app on my laptop. The web app access was not previously counted as a “synced” device, but after a recent update Evernote has been forcing me to either subscribe to their premium service or unsync one of my devices.

Scrolling down the bar to the bottom of the screen loads pages a little. I couldn’t find a good way to jump to the bottom page at once. And this happens in Mobile view.

On the one hand, I use it every single day on my iPad. I do a lot of reading/research for my job, so Notability has saved me from being buried under an endless pile of paper. I even pair it up with Scanbot so I can quickly scan materials in meetings and then have all my notes/handouts in a single place. Being able to search my handwriting is a game-changer! So is having access to my documents and notes everywhere, including my laptop, and having all changes and edits synced through iCloud. I’ve always wanted to go paperless with ubiquitous access to everything; Notability is my hub for that. Which brings me to my chief complaint about Notability: it’s iPhone app is terrible. It’s nice to see my notes on my phone if I need to skim something quickly on the go, but basic functionality is missing. You can’t search a document, highlight pages, see all the pages in a document—if you’re looking for something, you can only scroll until you find it. That’s ok if you’re talking about two pages of notes; but if you are looking at a 50 page journal article trying to find something, it’s ridiculous. Competitors have this functionality on iPhones, but Notability has never added it. I wish they would!

On tops of this, the line straitening and shape recognition is amazingly useful and easy, without being intrusive or correcting things that were not meant to be corrected. My one issue I have is with organization. Especially towards the end of the year when I have hundreds of notes and files, they can often be lost in the clutter. I have found ways around this by specifically labeling my files so all of my notes, quizzes, tests, and handouts are all sorted by category alphabetically, but I wish there was a way to put folders inside of subjects.

Very helpful features that provide flexibility to working on and organizing notes have been eliminated, I guess in the name of tidiness: opening multiple main windows, changing the created date (so helpful for arranging the notes in the order I want), magnifying the words in the editing window (which now cannot be done without magnifying everything else, making it unreasonably cumbersome to operate the sidebar). Then there are countless bugs throughout the software that keeps giving you frustrating surprises. The recent major upgrade demonstrates the team's disregard for the working habits of established users, and also raises concerns about quality control. In so many respects the new version simply isn't ready, and it's unclear to me why the company would be in a rush to release an update.

There should be a math or shape mode that you can toggle on and off that auto recognizes shapes and fixes them. Having an math text mode that auto recognizes math notation would also be fantastic ... p.s. OneNotes version of this is poorly executed. 3)**** when I record lectures, I am always slightly behind when note taking. If there were an advanced feature where we could choose where the audio track lines up with the notes, that would be spectacular. Revisited notes would be much superior and would be more like sitting through the lecture again.****4) there should be an option to directly add in PDFs to our notes.

Need to have a better navigation support for pdf (textbooks). Annotating a pdf paper is no problem, but reading a 500-page long textbook can be a little painful in terms of navigating. Would be great if can support (recognize and could customize) outlines/super links. Also a thumbnail view support will be super helpful for a quick navigation and overview of the book.2.

A cute but non-essential thing that I like is that you can add GIFS to your notes. Another thing I like is the way you can separate your notes. You can put them in a subject folder but they at the same time stay separate. My favorite feature is that you can voice record as you write and when you do playbacks it highlights what you were writing as they say it. To me that is what makes Notability far superior than the other apps. I would definitely recommend getting Notability before any other app or at least trying it before purchasing something else.

I wish the app would provide another “straight line” tool like most other drawing and desktop publishing apps, so selecting it will make all lines straight.Handling text annotations is also awkward if you want the text placed in specific locations. The placed text requires different handling for moving, copying and deleting. The tools that allow you to delete, copy and move drawn lines do not work on text. Instead, it has it’s own set of operations (for example, to delete, you pause on it with the pencil, then apply another click which opens up a menu - not easy or intuitive).

Another thing that I really liked was all of the new updates that really helped with making things run more smoothly (i.e. the favorites bar, being able to search for key words within the notes themselves instead of just the title, and the magnifying glass). Some areas of improvement would be being able to adjust the shape of the magnifying box because there are sometimes when I’m trying to edit a specific place and the magnifying box just doesn’t fit right. Another thing would be to be able to open more than two notes at once. This would come in handy for those to do notes simultaneously on multiple sections. It would also be cool if when your in portrait mode for the notes you have the option to be able to stack the notes top of one another instead of seeing them side. Then one last area of adjustment would be to be able to have a bookmarked notes bar like how there is a bookmarked pages (within each notes) bar.

Not a problem!I’ve noticed that you have to have someone keep the same picture for about a month until the Gmail app actually updates it. If your friend changes it too much? Unfortunately, Gmail will just resort to a default picture, a random color (actually mostly a dark green color) with the first letter of their first name. Yeah. Horrible!Second, if you have multiple accounts and you just use the option “All Inboxes” Gmail will automatically sign you out if you don’t check that inbox separately. What an inconvenience.Third, if you accidentally swipe left on an email, it literally disappears forever. It took me forever to find the email. (Go to “All Mail” for accidentally archived emails.)

Text often create their own grids, at varying line heights, which makes the entire document very ugly. The sync is also on and off between my devices.

Wanted to take the time to write a review for an app I use every day of my life as a medical student. I love every amenity of this app. With my experience, I would like to give the developers a few ideas about how to further improve it. - A quicker color picker would be lovely. For example, being able to place 2-3 Favorite Colors at the top of the screen on the ribbon (1 tap is all we need)! Similar (but better) than having a physical pen with 4 different colored inks. - Another option would be to long-press with our finger/Apple pencil on a color on the screen to switch to that color. Both methods of integration would be awesome. The concept of Longpressing would need a time threshold before it accepts the input as such, so a slider in milliseconds would be ideal. I recommend this for the “Shapes Detection” option also (because we hesitate sometimes..). - Gestures would be nice too! One that immediately comes to mind is double tapping = undo. - On my MacBook and iPad, the Text Box is a little wonky. It assumes I want the box to be a certain width and doesn’t automatically format my text within it. Some tweaks (or advice?) on that may be necessary..These are just quality of life adjustments I have noticed would really make the app absolutely perfect.

Another thing that I really liked was all of the new updates that really helped with making things run more smoothly (i.e. the favorites bar, being able to search for key words within the notes themselves instead of just the title, and the magnifying glass). Some areas of improvement would be being able to adjust the shape of the magnifying box because there are sometimes when I’m trying to edit a specific place and the magnifying box just doesn’t fit right. Another thing would be to be able to open more than two notes at once. This would come in handy for those to do notes simultaneously on multiple sections. It would also be cool if when your in portrait mode for the notes you have the option to be able to stack the notes top of one another instead of seeing them side. Then one last area of adjustment would be to be able to have a bookmarked notes bar like how there is a bookmarked pages (within each notes) bar. It would make jumping between two desired note documents a little bit easier.Anyways, that’s it from me.
