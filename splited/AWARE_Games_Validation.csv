This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it’s not free in the first place. No, I don’t want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it’s just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the “end turn” button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose “auction” instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab. And the playability stuff should never have made it past QA.",This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services.,5,True,cost,positive,1

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it’s not overwhelming, it’s a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it’s because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it’s worth.  But, great game!",The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.,4,True,enjoyability,negative,4

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9. This needs to be fixed ASAP.,It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.,3,True,general,positive,5

I think we should have an improvement or 2 (I’m not sure if it is 2, but it’s still worth the game) for this. It has an excellent interference facing the game but there can be simply a better idea for the game. Also, it has a awesome story. It tells about a person about a house that has to be renovated. This takes talent. The only way is that we did our skills. And the puzzles facing our ways. That’s the concert. To be honest, it also has days. This never happened in most games in my life. The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don’t know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing.

It’s fun but it totally clickbait me on Instagram with the little games that I haven’t seen once after downloading. I’ve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you’re remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn’t enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you’re getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it. I shouldn’t have to waste it because I had work or class. Sometimes you can’t play for 2 hours at that very second.

I love that I can still customize but I feel like there are fewer options to customize. I don’t like all of the options but being able to play shortened games is an absolute plus. I wish I could still choose the money we start with The looks sharp and the tokens move quickly.

It’s a lot of fun!There is one thing that I would love to see. When you get a power up like the coin magnet or the bouncy shoes a little flash of light shoots out! Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away.

Not that they’re not working extra hard to make you do it... When I started playing, it was fun because I always had a chance to win. The kite will do what it’s supposed to and the bombs won’t go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won’t go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn’t as hard either. You didn’t need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It’s now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won’t let you win. If I was frustrated before, I’m finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they’re taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

It is really hard to play the game with a chat limit.

I know this was for a good reason and it was meant to make things easier, but it really doesn’t. Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‘you are an idiot!’ that would be double awesome!! I actually really dislike the chat and now that I think about it you should just take out the new chat feature that you put in. Also, since the update happened there have been SOOOOOO many glitches and I can almost never rejoin a game because it turns black and I have to swipe out and then join a new game every time.

Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it’s perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don’t understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven’t seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I’ve seen it happen to others.Update: I’ve now discovered that the “Automatic role” system is very bad for me. I’ve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it’s rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day.

Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game.

Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star",These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing.,1,True,aesthetics,positive,0

It’s cute, it’s colorful and you feel accomplished when you fix the tv or replace the chair. The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. 😄 and I’m glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It’s annoying how fast your stars run out. What’s even more annoying, it’s that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you’ve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I’m saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! 😆     Please take this into consideration. The game would be much more entertaining and exciting if I didn’t give up so much on the game. Thank you 🐘🐘🐘",At least the game is a little better.,3,True,general,positive,5

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won’t let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it’s fixed though. That doesn’t mean it’s fine though, because if you don’t notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it’s hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can’t avoid it. There are a few others that aren’t as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on. I also have screen recordings of the first glitch and this one.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",One of the things I like about this game is that there are no ads.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn’t inhibit game play as the shapes are so different. However the ice bombs are all the same shape and in grayscale I cannot tell them apart as they are too close in tone to their one another and not identical in tone to the matching shape. It is frustrating.On a completely different note. I am convinced Austin is dead and this whole game is an afterlife experience. Otherwise the back story of him as a butler (second generation no less) whose family as this fabulous history and mansion makes very little sense. The butler conceit causes other problems as well. I HATE having to spend stars to sweep or dust when Austin sweeps to “alienate boredom,” and often enough to warrant concerns about it being an obsessive behavior... maybe he isn’t dead, maybe his parents sent him to a special program for individuals with extreme obsessive behavior, the Institute wasn’t a school for butlers, it was an institution for individuals with special needs such as delusional thinking and obsessive behavior.",The butler conceit causes other problems as well.,4,True,efficiency,negative,3

I don’t mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don’t want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well. I’ll rate Subway Surfers as 5 ⭐️ if the ad issues are solved, because the game play and reward system is great.",What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out?,4,True,safety,positive,8

It helps me when I get home from school. Hands down this is the best game ever, and if you’re reading this you should definitely get it. It has structures to explore, over 30 biomes, achievements to get, about 85, you can playin friends worlds, in your own worlds, and if you sign in to Xbox live you can pay on servers with players across the globe. You can play worlds in survival or creative, with cheats on or off. The 5 default servers are The Hive, Lifeboat, Mineplex, Mineville City, and Cubecraft games. But there are tons of other servers around too. It constantly updates proving it won’t go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile. If you’re looking for an awesome game, get Minecraft.Suggestion:	Maybe in the create world slot you could add more textures and not just the default. You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there’s not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that’s really all that’s important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game. There’s only a bow and crossbow, maybe you could have an AK-47, or a Sniper Rifle, really anything just please add guns.","If you’re looking for an awesome game, get Minecraft.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Before I downloaded this app I read all the reviews! Everything everyone said about it is so true, yet you do nothing about it! I think a game should be fun and challenging but not frustrating!

Sad because it could be so much fun! 😕I see the developers still really don’t give a crap. After reading so many complaints on here and the developers never even answer one of them. I am not using my stars on putting up decorations in the kitchen. Dumb! Why have so many rooms when you can’t get into them? Ridiculous! I really only play it when I absolutely have nothing else to do because I’ll never get to really decorate the house. I thought that was the point of the game.

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.  These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.",Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.,2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048. Even if you restart the app, restart your phone, or your phone dies, your progress WOULD NEVER BE LOST!!! EVER! Why can Subway Surfers be like that?

I downloaded the latest update, got on it to check out all of the new features they added, but it went into super-lag mode, and won't really allow me to even legitimately play it. Usually, after trying to play for 30 seconds or so, the app will kick me, along with my iPod heating up A LOT. This is the only device I really have to play Minecraft PE on. So, I would really appreciate a fix in the next update that will improve the game efficiency-wise. And, next time there is a big update that will lag older devices, don't allow those devices to be updated. At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still. Will take a few seconds to work, and device still heats. Only reason not one star is because I didn't technically review the update features.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning.

It will be someone else’s turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they “end turn” & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930’s board I love all of them.

It has been about two months. Another problem is that the new update (in my opinion) has made the game look very old and childish. It looks like it is from the 90s. I highly dislike the new style of the game. I also purchased double coins many years ago and now I cannot get it back even when I restore my purchase. I’m not going to waste my time emailing the company because I will not get an answer. The items in the game are also way too expensive. It took me almost 3 weeks of playing for about 45 minutes a day to get the hoverboard that I wanted.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes.

With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.","It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly.",3,True,efficiency,negative,3

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes.

All my games just so happen to go the same way.  At first, because the AI is on easy mode, I to great! I’m usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls. This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI’s came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. “Which happened consecutively”",The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.,3,True,cost,positive,1

I LOVE IT!!!,"I’ve been playing Subway Surfers since I was a little kid and practically grew up with it. Even now I think it’s such a fun and exciting game. It definitely can help pass time. Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn’t get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have “hype” I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don’t really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can’t continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.","The match game itself feels pretty comparable to others, what I enjoy though is that beating a level allows you to make transformations.",4,True,effectiveness,positive,2

Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18.

The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars.",3,True,cost,negative,1

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!",Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It’s fun but it totally clickbait me on Instagram with the little games that I haven’t seen once after downloading. I’ve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you’re remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn’t enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you’re getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it. I shouldn’t have to waste it because I had work or class. Sometimes you can’t play for 2 hours at that very second.

BUT I have some requirements. Number one is EMOJIS. We really need some emojis to express how we fell and to make talking with others easier. I mean I’m trying to make faces with text and it doesn’t let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it’s easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I’m not complaining that mobile players get updates later I’m just saying that at the time I’m typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can’t update. Now I don’t know how updates for this game work since I’ve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1. I understand that these things are probably difficult to do but I really think that these would make the game better. But then again I’m not a game creator so I don’t know how this is.

Let me add...Before the update I had no ads what so ever! But now I get ads after every run! I only keep this game just because my high score is 2.6 million. The game is way choppier than it used to be too! Also before the update kinda a while back Star Jake used to be 30 keys to unlock! I used him all the time! But now you have to get 150 spray cans! The part that’s annoying me the most is after the update...I had to unlock Star Jake AGAIN! All I have to say to the people that had the classic Subway Surfers... Do YOU like this update? It really wasn’t worth updating the game...I was kinda happy about the loading screen though! I will say that! One more thing... I noticed the multiplier challenges...I’m at 23x... but  I was doing challenges...when I noticed...”23/30 is the 30x the max multiplier? That’s also a bad idea if it is! I had a multiplier of 32x before the update.

They don’t have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account.

It’s a lot of fun!There is one thing that I would love to see. When you get a power up like the coin magnet or the bouncy shoes a little flash of light shoots out! Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away.

It is rather annoying to have to buy additional decks, but I was shocked when I found out that the decks cannot be accessed by my own family members on their respective phones.  I had downloaded the Harry Potter, Marvel bundle and Star Wars decks onto my phone with the reasonable expectation that my wife, son and daughter would be able to use them as well.  It is understandable that Ellen DeGeneres would want to make money, but it is terribly petty and unbecoming to be this greedy.

Then...it got harder and harder to pass levels. I have little money to spend so I rarely buy “helps” but I do write reviews when I love a game and tell friends to check it out. I haven’t played Gardenscapes for weeks now—though I sometimes open it up to look at how pretty the garden is and to tell Austin I’m still on vacation and to take care of the house. With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end. I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games—and even that doesn’t get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated.

Very clean visually, smooth gameplay and the AI is smart enough to give you a real challenge. However, this game has one major flaw that makes it entirely not worth buying until fixed. While playing single player mode offline, I’ve noticed roughly 1 in every 2 games, usually towards the end once all the properties have been bought, the AI will move and at the end of the turn it will just stop with the camera focused on the character leaving you unable to continue. Oddly, you can exit out, close the app, renter, hit resume game and the frozen character will go again. Unfortunately, after the character moves, once again, frozen.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

It is so easy to use, and the 4 dollars that I paid for it was so worth it! This beats any other Monopoly app that I have used BY FAR. It lets you get all the same Monopoly experiences as the board game, such as auctions, but the game is way faster! Also, there are absolutely NO ads! It lets you customize the game rules, too! For example, you can change the number of houses you need to have on a property before you can buy a hotel. My favorite thing about this game is the hassle-free games!

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I’ve personally played. I’ve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don’t give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that’s an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I’ve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I’m literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

This gets you in a competitive mood and makes the game much more fun.#3: Unlocking characters and boards is another way to have more fun in the game.

You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can’t get all the characters.

Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6.

Like in the beginning when I was trying to repair the entry hall, the can of paint spilled. I know that it only took 1 star to clean it up, but really? That part was a waste of coding and time for one little thing that they don’t need, and it was annoying. I just started playing, and I already like it, but I also see that it will be a little stubborn and slow at certain times. And in Austin’s room, when your done with it and everything looks new, there’s a dusty old desk that doesn’t go with the room, and I felt  like I should replace it, but I can’t. There were a few more parts that didn’t need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin’s dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn’t have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep? Also, if nobody had lived in the house for years, why where the clothes on the statues not dusty? If you make another game from another game then shouldn’t you mention it?

I’ve probably attempted 8-9 online multiplayer games and finished 2 of them. Typically I get about 15-25 minutes into the game (fairly invested) and then the game decides to start bugging out. Ie. All the pieces disappear as well as ur dice, make trade button, mortgage button and end turn button. Nothing comes back, no players move it’s done. Any who I give it 2 stars becuse at least the single player is fairly functional. But really for one included board design, and for the lack of in game features, no ability to pan around board no pinch and expand, Can’t leave app and renter.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like “Blah is the imposter!” or “Blah vented!” (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn’t figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don’t say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put “I am having trouble using the chat,” or something like that?

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

But the thing is if you have a really good score the week before, IT ALL GOES AWAY THE NEXT WEEK!!! I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that’s all I have to say on the negative side of things. But on the positive side, this game is an amazing pass time if you want to spend some mindless time in quarantine. It is also overall just really fun.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It’s ultimately a great game. Here’s some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don’t need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone’s been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That’s all my requests for now. Thank you!",It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend.,5,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Two were bankrupt and I got all of their property and fully populated them with houses and hotels. But every time this other player, who has three hotels, lands in a place where they have to pay me a thousand dollars or so,they collect all their money through mortgages and selling their hotels, but then the setting button disappears and they don’t give me the money. The bored is still moving, but I’m not getting paid. I’ve tried closing the game and it either lets them redo their move so I don’t get payed, or they stay there and keep going but I still don’t get payed. It wouldn’t have bankrupted them, but it would give me over 3000 dollars? Maybe that’s why? I don’t know. But it’s very annoying.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.","Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.",2,True,cost,negative,1

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me. Whatever.  I play it enough I would probably pay it.  But don’t give me the run around and nickel and dime me.  You could spend $100 dollars on this game and NOT UNLOCK EVERYTHING.  are you kidding me?     Change the incentive structure and cost of everything ASAP.  Either offer more coins or lower the prices of the items to get.  I bought the double coins feature.  Still takes a week of playing to buy 1 board.  Then you want to talk about keys?

So now we can play to our hearts content!! I remember there being a Monopoly in the App Store awhile ago and I absolutely loved it, but our iPad crashed and I couldn’t find another one until now. There is one thing that I loved about the old one that this new one doesn’t have and that’s is: while you are playing you could look and see how much % chance this certain lot would be landed on and by whom. For example, when I’m trying to build a house I’d look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I’d build the house on.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It’s the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes? Are they replaced with an AI? If so, why doesn’t it tell me that I’m playing AI? Is the game freezing from and idle player? If so, can there be a boot timer? Are people rewarded for finishing games? Are people penalized for not finishing games?

We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server? I don’t appreciate having to pay $7 for a game I can’t even play. I tried everything and nothing seemed to work. I just wanted to play with my cousin to relieve my boredom and all this game did was constantly remind me of it.",There is no way this could just be my internet.,1,True,reliability,negative,7

It makes you push yourself harder and harder to beat the other people’s high score. This gets you in a competitive mood and makes the game much more fun.#3: Unlocking characters and boards is another way to have more fun in the game. You collect keys and coins over and over until you have enough to unlock that character that you just HAD to have. This gives you another thing to work towards.Although the game has many fun features, it also has a few problems. Here is why I left off two stars#1: Let me set the scene: You’ve seen everybody else have subway surf, so you beg your mom to let you get it. She says yes, so you go to the App Store and download it. You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can’t get all the characters. Some of them cost money , and some of them you have to have a certain social media for, and some people aren’t old enough to have FaceBook or whatever.Overall it’s a fun game but don’t plan on it being addicting for very long",You collect keys and coins over and over until you have enough to unlock that character that you just HAD to have.,3,True,general,positive,5

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I’m not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that’s still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game! Sorry I couldn’t give it a 5, but I will if you fix the issues 🥺. Keep making great games!",Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that’s a little annoying in my opinion.,4,True,efficiency,negative,3

I just thought of a few new mobs I would like for the developers to add into Minecraft! I hope they at least add in one of them. 1. Skele-Fish. It is a fish that can be found in all water sources in every biome, except for swamps. It can only spawn in when the world is in easy, normal, or hard. It can drop up to 3 bones when killed, it doesn’t attack you unless if you attack it first,  (just like when you hit a wolf in survival when it isn’t tamed to anyone in that world) it deals three hearts when it attacks you, and it has a body made of bones with no eyes. 2. Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won’t attack you back. But when it isn’t in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin. It only spawns in snowy plains and on icebergs. They eat raw fish of any type, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them. They have a white belly and the rest is all-black. They do not attack you when you hit them in easy, normal, or hard.",I just thought of a few new mobs I would like for the developers to add into Minecraft!,5,True,general,positive,5

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang. Thank you for changing my life.","Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app.",5,True,general,positive,5

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren’t fair, they’re only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It’s laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn’t they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It’s insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

The worlds were not “adult” themed and I felt my 11 year old could have heard every world. They used the word “areola” for gods sake and found it offensive that a scientific term for a female body part was considered “adult” or “dirty”.

Instead, the game is a candy crush style game where you get stars and coins for every level you beat. With the stars you can customize your mansion and continue the story of a butler and his family. The coins are just meant to be saved up to buy power ups and refill lives (the lives regenerate).

This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it’s working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can’t even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can’t get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it’s not getting fixed. If this problem doesn’t get fixed, I’m deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.  I really hope this problem can get solved, because I really enjoy playing Minecraft, and I don’t want to loose all of my progress.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else’s review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea.

For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

I refresh the servers, and there’s barely any. I try another one, same problem. I’m usually spending at least 2-3 minutes just trying to join a game with settings I like. Another thing that happens a lot is that when I refresh the servers, there’s none available! I’m not sure if this is a me problem, but PLEASE fix this!!

There’s probably a bunch of people getting impatient, you really gotta hurry up.Suggestions: A friending system, I’ve met so many nice people when playing! It would be nice for a friending system! Another suggestion is more customization, there’s only 12 colors along with a not so massive selection of hats. I’m not allowed to buy anything online, so it would be cool for more customization for people that can’t afford to buy more hats and things! My final suggestion is MORE GAMEMODES!!!

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven’t been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn’t they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren’t just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game.

Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it’s really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don’t have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it.

This extra step should not be necessary. The other reason I am writing this four stars is because of the AI players sometimes make a terrible trading deal, where one AI ends up with a full street and ready to build houses, where the other is still needing another street, so basically getting the short end of the stick.

It is just like the old monopoly I used to play except way faster because the money was automatically transferred. I do have some complaints though. If you’re gonna make an app cost money, don’t have in-app purchases that cost more than the game itself. There is some small details that I am slightly concerned about. If you spam click a property you want to mortgage then you lose money until you can’t click it anymore. When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice. I am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings. It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool. These are just minor issues that I would be fine if they didn’t change. Over all, this was a great game to play with my family and I highly recommend playing it because you can pay 15 dollars for the real version or 4 bucks for a virtual version that goes faster.",It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board.,4,True,general,negative,5

If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I’m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It’s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load.

But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks.

So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn’t let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat. Anyway I joined a game and my screen turned black when the game started again! So I deleted the app, reset my phone, and reinstalled it and the same things happened again!

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

There also needs to be (this is the feature I want the most) to be a statistics option where you can see how many wins and losses, minutes played etc. and lastly, there should be a clock on the top of the screen, because when you exit this app, maybe to check the time, it disconnects you from the game entirely.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it’s really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don’t have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it. That’s why I don’t like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.",For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body.,4,True,enjoyability,negative,4

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can’t because you’re out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don’t have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups.

Don’t get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take. Other then that, this game is THE BEST game EVER! I would really recommend downloading this game on your phone or iPad right now.","I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called.",1,True,learnability,positive,6

To my mind, there aren’t many ads, they do pop up across the home screen occasionally, but you can X out of those easy enough. The other ads are for rewards, which makes it worth it. The actual game is neat. I like the power ups you can get in game, ESPECIALLY the mystery hoverboard. I wish it’d appear more often. It’s really cool to be able to test out the different powers. If I had to change something, I’d want to make an in game option where if you’re ready to leave the game but don’t want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it’s be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there’d be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it’d have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is.

In multiplayer matches I see a huge disadvantage of playing against players who are really good in playing. Accuracy and shooting of opponents are far tough to survive through especially in domination mode in multiplayer matches.Gameplay must be also set in terms of measuring a players’ aiming, shooting accuracy and shooting speed in order to prevent matches from getting extremely tough.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

First of all when the game updated it basically restarted the game and got rid of all my coins, keys, characters...everything.

If I did and they deleted everything then that would mean I just spent and wasted a whole lot of money. And I’m pretty sure that is what happened to other people who bought stuff using real money. Another thing is the design. It’s not that great. The graphics and layout are really childish. And now for some reason the game takes FOREVER to load.

Second, the animations are so annoying!  (Frankly, they were annoying in the old version, too) They are in the way so I can’t see the right side of the board. They are too long and they don’t get shorter when you play a quick game. Third, some of the options in the older version aren’t in the newer one like removing those animations, slight of hand, starting allowance, starting properties, etc.  Fourth, it’s pretty obvious whose turn it is, so I don’t need an obnoxious banner across the screen before every freaking turn!  Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It’s like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can’t get one.

I’ve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I don’t even know what’s after that, because it’s just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I’ve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can’t! I don’t mind spending the money here and there, but it’s so expensive, it doesn’t even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it’s even more expensive if you want power ups! I’m not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don’t make some changes. It’s beginning to add up with how many coins I’ve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn’t applying the power ups correctly.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you’ve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there’s no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it’s a fun game, but there’s room for improvement.

But if you’re over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game’s players are under 18 and I don’t think that people over 13 really need that level of “internet safety” protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say “(A) was running away from the body.” Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don’t have options to say it, but when it does happen you can’t do anything about it. That’s why I don’t like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.",I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18.,4,True,safety,positive,8

The game rarely glitched and overall was the best mobile game I’d found in a while. But after this last update I can’t say that anymore. I love the idea of not showing who voted who ( it really helps with the occasional bullies) and I like the point of the update. Next I will say what I would like you to add adding friends, maybe more maps ( I like the ones you have but a big Change like that sound good), no hacking ( it’s still happening just not the full game bug you guys had), and actual bug fixes. Let me explain the last one or why I can’t say I love the game anymore. Earlier today I was playing with my younger sister and teaching her to play, sounds fun right? Well it was but soon after we had to make a new game bc people weren’t able to stay on our game with being kicked off for no reason. So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn’t even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now. Pease actually do bug fixes and please read this and take note of how your game is extremely glitchy and isn’t a fun game anymore.

I love how you get to visit new locations (BTW I’ve been to Amsterdam so it was fun to see it in the game.), get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.I personally think that the graphics are great. They don’t have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don’t need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device. I remember him being very expensive and I would love a way to sign into that account on another device so I could get Tagbot back.Thank you for reading this review.

It’s annoying I’ve only had this game for a week and I’m uninstalling it. You need stars to complete tasks and you only get one when u pass the level. As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it’s not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone. I recommend finding another game to play unless you have plenty of patience for bull*hit.,Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do.,2,True,general,negative,5

It’s just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven’t stopped playing since. Although it’s a very well made very fun to play game, there’s some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media’s out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It’s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot.

I mean, it doesn’t even have a part where you can ask for people to watch you do a visual! I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn’t fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don’t have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids. It really takes something away from the game when most of the people are stuck to a few sentences that doesn’t even include some vital stuff to the game, as mentioned before with the inability to ask for people to see them do a visual task. It is even at the point where I am considering deleting and reinstalling the game to be able to use the old chat system. It brought the rating down from a 7/5 to a 3/5.

First was ads that would play after clicking on the home icon. I don’t mind ads that I choose to watch because I want to double my reward, but I don’t want to see ads when moving from one screen to the next. The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don’t want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that’s playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well.

So the lag is probably the main issue here FIX THIS PLEASE. This game means a lot to me I’ve played it with my mom for a very long time don’t screw it up now. Moving on to the next issue. The character select. Sometimes I get in and it’s fine. A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don’t show up. Moving on to the next issue. This may be on purpose and if it is it ain’t hittin right! There is distortion with the little heavenly voices sound when opening something or getting a prize. It gets extremely deep and stuff and doesn’t sound right. Moving on the the next and last issue. We can’t get these cakes in five days especially with all this lag.

The point of every game is to be challenging, what’s the fun if it isn’t. This game however takes challenging to a whole other level! As I’ve said it other post, this is not a game of skill. It’s all based if the game allows the pieces to fall, the boosters to point in the direction needed to win. A blind monkey can play this game because it’s all luck, like a slot machine. Most levels, no matter if they are regular, hard, or super hard take 2-3 lives to beat. I will say, I have on very rare occasion beat a level on the first attempt. Currently I am on level 214 “super hard” I have attempted to beat this level no less than 25 times, maybe more! Challenging 🙄?  Let’s change the game to mission impossible 🤣😭!

And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the “how to”, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won’t be able to stop playing!

Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I’ll be wearing their skin, and they’ll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I’ve tried everything. I’ve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it’s not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I’m writing this) doesn’t even let me into the game. I’ve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don’t know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes.

BUUUUT having said that, I have become so addicted to this game, checking in on it several times a day and can’t wait for my lives to regenerate and LOVE it when I finally win a particularly difficult level. I do wish that the rewards were a little more generous. And that things didn’t cost so much gold I mean 900 for only 5 more moves! That just kills my stash! But I keep playing so 🤷🏼‍♀️It kills me to admit that I have spent money to buy more gold coins in order to keep playing or buy more boosts, and to buy the gold is $5.99 which even though i paid for it I feel is a bit steep. I wish that more of the gold you win for beating each level went to you instead of into your piggy bank, that is very frustrating!! But here I am still playing. I might have to delete it to spare my own piggy bank. ***I finally had to delete it*** I refuse to throw away any more money on something so frivolous but kept getting stuck on these ridiculously hard levels with no helps and not enough gold to buy any more. :( they really need to lower the cost of things and give you more gold when you win a level.

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

But it comes with so many glitches that it literally becomes impossible to reach the end of a game. Just played 3 games with my friends online, and all 3 ended prematurely due to glitches or malfunctions.For starters, if your phone receives any notifications that pop up on screen, you run the risk of being disconnected from your online multiplayer Monopoly games. This includes pop-up notifications for texts, emails, phone calls, other apps, anything. And especially don’t think about quickly exiting the app for any reason, that’s a guaranteed disconnect. But even if you play the game without distractions, certain mechanics start to breakdown after enough time passes. You’ll draw Community Chest cards to pay $50 only for the debt to not be taken from your account. You’ll roll the dice only for them to disappear and your turn to never end, the token never moving and it being impossible to reroll the dice. You’ll make a trade offer, only for the game to freeze and be impossible to resume.My friends have so much fun playing on the app, but have only successfully completed a handful of games since the app’s release.

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn’t require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you’re placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you’re ranked in the lower levels I’m convinced this game randomly “loosens up” and you’re able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I’m convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game “tightens up” and it’s impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.",My only quibble is the programming of the computer players.,4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I do not recall anyone who has this problem that I know, but that is because most of my friends do not play Subway surfers. There is also a problem with the new “tankbot”. I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said “loading”. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review.

Finally, the main reason I got this version was because I was hoping the trade AI would get better, but not really. It got slightly better when doing a human to computer trade, but the computer to computer trades are pathetic. It’s like they all gang up to get monopolies so the human can’t get one.

This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi.

I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

In the actual game you have to play a matching game and place furniture down.      The good thing about this game is that it is super fun and not to hard to play. It has easy instructions on how to play and what to do. I also like how I have a choice of three things to pick from when I’m picking furniture,rugs,wallpaper,exc.

Great challenge system implemented; giving players “Milestones” looking forward. Games like this can easily be repetitive, the challenge system doesn’t completely take that away but definitely helps. Great app for the current version, runs perfect on my iPhone SE. if I could change anything it would possible be different subway backgrounds to give a different feel for where you maybe few examples “abandoned subway” like the one in Cincinnati Ohio, or New York or Boston type of Subway. I’m sure the devs could possibly implement something of that nature rather simple. Then you could make a “premium” version thus driving more revenue to make more great games. Possibly more power ups to run with, premium players would get access to free power ups once a month maybe 5 of each that can be “stackable” and do not expire. Just a few ideas and an actual helpful review not someone crying about how the game restarted on them or bashing you for bugs that nearly every app will encounter here and there.

A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I’ll be wearing their skin, and they’ll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I’ve tried everything. I’ve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it’s not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I’m writing this) doesn’t even let me into the game. I’ve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don’t know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes. It doesn’t kick me out, just freezes on that and won’t go into the game. I’m becoming impatient, waiting for it to go into the game and it still won’t. I swipe up the app then go on it again, only for the same result, over and over. No matter how many apps I’ve had before, it’s never done this and I don’t know what to do.

Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints. Thank you!",I really thought it be more of a challenge.,3,True,security,positive,9

This app is amazing, along with its beautiful, tear-bringing soundtrack. As I look back on the app, it has changed so much. It sounds crazy, but I almost wish it was back to the days when you lived off of cows and used boats, but now it’s all cheats and crazy builds and bees. But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don’t even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us. I know this is long, but this game is so worth it. Great job, Mojang, and Notch, and all the others.

I’ve been playing cave game, now Minecraft for as long as it’s been out. I remember how you could press g or h and you could “Clone” yourself. The old days of classic. I remember when there was a girl in Minecraft, and the old avatars.. (Notch messed up a bit..) it’s a fun and awesome game. The days of beta were the best. I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb’s wife (I think it’s Jeb’s..) liked polar bears, so that’s why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it’s been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I’m more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches’ family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don’t want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft!

But recently it’s been laggy, glitchy and it even crashes when I try to play. Normally the game isn’t that slow but when ever I’m not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn’t a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won’t have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.","However, when there isn’t a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive.",4,True,cost,negative,1

It’s super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join’s game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask “hey any (insert gender) here?” “What’s ur snap?” “Hey how old are you?” It’s really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it’s later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

The main issue I have is with disconnecting from servers or the app crashing. And both are CONSTANT! It’s so incredibly frustrating hosting a room of incredible people, which takes A REALLY LONG TIME to accomplish, only to disconnect shortly after. Sometimes the game will shut my room down due to “inactivity” despite constant chatting and people coming in & out, especially because it takes FOREVER to fill a room. On top of that, I’m constantly getting a pop up when I disconnect saying I have an older version of the game, even though no update is available. To the creators of among us- GET IT TOGETHER! You KNOW this is the most popular game on the market right now, so please stop ignoring these issues and make the effort to fix them. These issues are so constant that it makes me not want to play anymore, and I’ve talked to many others that feel the same way. Just because everyone loves the game doesn’t mean people won’t start hating it because of the big persistent issues we all face multiple times in one sitting.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!",Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren’t just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S. I heard the developers are working on a game called among us 2 and I think it will include all of these features and I am soooo excited for that!",I would 100% recommend this game.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn’t get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it’s just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you’re bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you’re friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you’re working on isn’t a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it’s hard.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that’s not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don’t blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that’s all I have to say on the negative side of things. But on the positive side, this game is an amazing pass time if you want to spend some mindless time in quarantine. It is also overall just really fun.

The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it.

The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

The levels with soap bubbles or oil spreading while you try to keep it at bay while solving the actual puzzle is ridiculous and next to impossible. Only getting 5 tries at a time to solve a puzzle like that (unless you get a random surprise “reward” of 30-60 mins, or a few hours of unlimited play) is frustrating beyond words.

I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason.

Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away.

If so I would recommend picking up your phone and download Subway Surfers. I love to just sit back and run on the train tracks for hours. What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

First of all, when I open a deck and press play instead of saying “ Put on your fore head” but it just flip over, Second of all the screen sometimes went blue and it is stuck there, Third of all after a deck the camera froze.

I would really like being able to use emojis in game because I ( my opinion ) REALLYYYY like to express my feelings with emojis. I’m not sure if most people agree why we should add emojis but I’m pretty sure a few of us want emojis. 😉 The second thing is friending each other. Sometimes I make friends but then ( because of my un-lucky life.. ) I always have to go! Then when I tell them, I get so sad because they are my friends! I would really like for you to add friend requesting in the game!! 🙃  The third thing is when your alive, you can only chat in emergency meetings. Sometimes I see a person vent... but before I can hit the Emergency Meeting button, they kill me. I get quite annoyed because I’m usually the person who ends up being the last crewmate. So, I also lose the game and not really angry but kind of annoyed! I feel bad saying this just so you know 🙃. Those are all my suggestions! Hope a few of them get added!!!!!!

I’ve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it’s come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It’s stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It’s a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn’t let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the “how to”, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won’t be able to stop playing! Trust me, you won’t regret getting it!!!💕💕","Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs.",5,True,general,negative,5

It was really fun just trying to get the highest run and the biggest amount of coins. But then, a couple of years after the app came into being, it's levels changed up. It gained new challenges and new characters which did help the game but that classic opening was almost completely gone. I come back a few years later and they are still doing the tour. I mean how long does a tour around the world really take? And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same. There is an ad after almost every run. If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away. It made my experience worse. I'm sorry if you really like this game but I can't accept a game that has taken the social media route of selling their customers to the ad companies.","And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same.",2,True,aesthetics,negative,0

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that’s 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it’s a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they’ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard. It’s my tiny moral victory. But hey, great time waster so if that’s what you’re going for, you’ll likely stay engaged and distracted from your reality and isn’t that what we all want anyways?","One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players.",3,True,general,negative,5

When I first downloaded this game it was because of an ad that I’d seen, and the demo allowed me to pick out which furniture, which wallpaper, etc. Then I downloaded Homescapes and played, even spent some money on it because I was having fun and wanted to keep progressing. Now all the ads I see for this game don't make sense. I see some where the main characters are trapped on an island and they are being attacked by a shark, some where they are stranded in the cold and freezing, and within the last couple days I saw two more that DONT MAKE SENSE! The guy has to pee and he’s running down the hall and things are breaking. Then the reason I wrote this review is because I was so confused and disturbed by the one I just saw: the guy has his hands and feet tied to bed posts and the room is on fire and he wants to escape. That seems macabre and violent; who tied him there... his parents? It’s creepy when you compare it to the actual innocent and child friendly gameplay. What in the world was that ad?! Why would you make that strange violent ad to promote this game? I’m disturbed... lol... it’s been months and months since I’ve seen an ad that depicts anything similar to the actual gameplay. :/","Then I downloaded Homescapes and played, even spent some money on it because I was having fun and wanted to keep progressing.",3,True,cost,positive,1

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical “offers” they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as “easy, medium, or hard” just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they’re fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

At first it was cool and you know like fun. But when I started getting to play the game a lot then I told myself  ‘’ ever since I played the game there was barely any updates and it’s starting to get boring’’. It’s like it’s fun but not fun at the same time. 1 : is because barely any updates . 2 : TOO EXPENSIVE BRO!!! 3 : Ik know it’s kinda the same like number 1 but the police officer STYLE IS GETTING SOOO BORING  It would be cool if you can unlock new police officers !!! 4: The places are getting boring and it would be awesome if we can buy places!!!! For these reasons I keep on deleting this game but there are also some things that are good also. The reason why I wrote this review is so the game could be better!!!

It’s cute, it’s colorful and you feel accomplished when you fix the tv or replace the chair. The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. 😄 and I’m glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It’s annoying how fast your stars run out. What’s even more annoying, it’s that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you’ve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I’m saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! 😆     Please take this into consideration. The game would be much more entertaining and exciting if I didn’t give up so much on the game.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.","In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property).",4,True,efficiency,positive,3

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.","So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",4,True,general,positive,5

It’s a really fun game that you should share with your friends and challenge each other. Sometimes you can even get a new high score.

BUT I have some requirements. Number one is EMOJIS. We really need some emojis to express how we fell and to make talking with others easier. I mean I’m trying to make faces with text and it doesn’t let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it’s easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I’m not complaining that mobile players get updates later I’m just saying that at the time I’m typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can’t update. Now I don’t know how updates for this game work since I’ve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1.

Here is why I left off two stars#1: Let me set the scene: You’ve seen everybody else have subway surf, so you beg your mom to let you get it. She says yes, so you go to the App Store and download it. You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven’t played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can’t get all the characters.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else’s review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending?

Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can’t because you’re out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don’t have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don’t get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don’t really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can’t continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins.,4,True,cost,negative,1

Dumping a gasoline can onto a fire causes you to lose. This game is nothing like they advertised so that was a huge let down. Other than that, the game is fun.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it’s too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I’m getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits. If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I’d even consider paying for that.","If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I’d even consider paying for that.",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

When you join “Online Multiplayer”, and you’re playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you’re paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they’ll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they’ll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they’ll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they’ll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you’re instantly replaced with an AI and there’s no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don’t want to erase all the progress you’ve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: “Online Multiplayer” isn’t online multiplayer. There may be one or two “real” people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that’s 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off.

I spent a little thinking it was just a hard level I needed to get by, but then every level after that has been just as hard. I play a lot of these match 3 games, and have done VERY well in them without having to spend a ton of money, it's just not fair to give a player 25 moves to accomplish 3 different things in one level! I want to keep playing because I like the concept and I like decorating the house, but I cannot keep spending money to beat levels, I've barely now made it to the kitchen and have probably spent $60 on this stupid game. And I see many many others have complained of the same thing. Wish I read reviews before I installed and got hooked. Game makers need to change the amount of moves you have on the levels or give more rewards for beating levels and get more lives quicker. I'll probably end up deleting if it doesn't change.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that’s 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I’ve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

If a player gets too powerful too early the game will purposely miss that players monopolies to almost absurd amount. I had six hotels on one side of the board and all other three players missed me for three complete cycles around the board. Still I couldn’t prove this until my last online game where I was able to quickly dominate the left side of the board with three hotels and four houses on each property for the other monopoly. I had just built the four houses and “rolled the dice” I landed on community chest and was asset building repairs. This should have been impossible since there are only two repair cards one for chance and the other for community chest. The community chest repair card had come up earlier and I counted the amount of cards played. It was seven. Since there are only 16 cards in community chest it should not have come up again for at least 8 more cards.  Game is entertaining but certainly not random.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now!

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.

A few glitches that I have experienced that get very annoying are things such as, when a friend joins, I’ll be wearing their skin, and they’ll be wearing mine (in their POV). It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I’ll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I’ve tried everything. I’ve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it’s not that). The most recent glitch for me, however, (which is why I’m writing this) doesn’t even let me into the game. I’ve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don’t know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes. It doesn’t kick me out, just freezes on that and won’t go into the game. I’m becoming impatient, waiting for it to go into the game and it still won’t. I swipe up the app then go on it again, only for the same result, over and over. No matter how many apps I’ve had before, it’s never done this and I don’t know what to do.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it’s too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I’m getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

I noticed that I would strive to get my pink and dark blue set every game, but nobody would land on them once I added houses and/or hotels. I noticed that they would skate right by and all of a sudden I keep going to jail when no player had been the entire game. After 30+ games, you start to notice trends. Today was kind of the breaking point for me when an AI owned Park Place and nobody owned Boardwalk. This was the beginning of the game and neither I nor the 3 AI’s had more than 2 or 3 properties and nobody was close to a set. I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each. I’m pretty intelligent and am very good at recognizing patterns.

Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win!

Now multiplayer is fun and all especially when I’m winning cuz I’ll have a few thousand and a row of hotels that bankrupt two other players. But then it’s always fun to just flash my wealth around and buy properties from the last player just so that it’s harder for them, but every time I do this (or just if I trade properties for money in general when someone’s bankrupt) it gets me stuck on the keep property mortgaged page. So I click unmorggage. Then I click it again. Then five minutes later I’m still spam clicking the button and I have to leave to solve the problem. I’ve tried everything I could but it always does this. Monopoly’s a great game and all but honestly I’ll probably just delete the game because it’s just annoying and frustrating when I have a hotel on boardwalk, all the railroads, and like 10 other hotels, while the other player has two properties left unmortgaged, then they win because the lousy game crashes on me.

It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that’s because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren’t any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

Also most of the time after we vote it all goes black and I just hear the sound of people leaving the game so I don’t know if that’s what is happening to other people too and that’s why I hear leaving but none the less it is a glitch that needs to be patched up.  I even waited a bit to see if it would go back to normal but guess what, it didn’t.  Thank you among us for your consideration for younger people by making the safety automated responses, but it’s really not doing it for me.  And please patch the glitch.

It is very entertaining any enjoyable to collect new characters, hover boards, daily challenge items, etc. I can’t stop playing it! Although it is very neat and fun to play, there are some things that I think should be taken note of. First of all, when I’m on the main screen on the game, I’m about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins. Later on I looked on the app and a new character was in, and was 100,000. Although there are some bugs in the game, it is very fun and I defiantly recommend getting it.","I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters.",4,True,cost,negative,1

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.  One good thing added to the game is the option to watch commercials to receive coins.

Quick chat just makes the game even more confusing it limits what you get to say. I know the editors of this game probably thought it was a smart idea because people were being mean and saying swearwords to each other but it’s a really bad idea because, it is more confusing than when I first got this game. I would love it if they removed the quick chat. And plus people are entering the game with their name as “me” or “i” to beat the System. So you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there’s a new player in the game that doesn’t even know how to chat. When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn’t want to see swearwords or if they wanted to. How about you add an account feature where you can make an account to have friends maybe a while-playing chat feature. Please take some of these ideas into consideration because the game is so big.

There also needs to be a friends list where you can add someone if you like them, because as of now you just lose that person forever. There also needs to be (this is the feature I want the most) to be a statistics option where you can see how many wins and losses, minutes played etc. and lastly, there should be a clock on the top of the screen, because when you exit this app, maybe to check the time, it disconnects you from the game entirely.

I had just built the four houses and “rolled the dice” I landed on community chest and was asset building repairs. This should have been impossible since there are only two repair cards one for chance and the other for community chest. The community chest repair card had come up earlier and I counted the amount of cards played. It was seven. Since there are only 16 cards in community chest it should not have come up again for at least 8 more cards.  Game is entertaining but certainly not random.

This has happened to me twice before, and each time I had multiple very accomplished worlds. What happens is that one second, it’s working just fine, and then when you try to get on it next time, you can’t even make it to the loading screen without it crashing. When this happens, it keeps happening, and you can’t get onto your Minecraft, not even onto your home screen, so you can try to find out what is wrong. Every time this happens to me, it is completely hopeless, and I end up deleting Minecraft. Then, when I redownload it, I lose all of my worlds, skins, servers, and everything except your Xbox live account, which you have to log back into. It is the most annoying thing ever, and I hate it so much. The reason I am actually writing this review is because I am hoping someone at Mojang will see it, and try to troubleshoot the problem. Also, when I tried to look up my problem on Minecraft forums, it looked like a bunch of other people have had the exact same problem, and it’s not getting fixed. If this problem doesn’t get fixed, I’m deleting Minecraft altogether because it was a complete waste of my money.  I really hope this problem can get solved, because I really enjoy playing Minecraft, and I don’t want to loose all of my progress.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.","The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful.",3,True,aesthetics,negative,0

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i’m not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I’ve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin’s fine. So anyway yeah that’s all. I personally still love this game to freaking pieces so keep up the good work Mojang.",And it only happens when I enter the minigame.,5,True,effectiveness,positive,2

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn’t make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It’s super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don’t have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this. It takes so long to even start getting to a place where you’re making money and getting people to land on your properties so going through all that just to quit because someone doesn’t want to play the game anymore is annoying.

However, within the game there are weekly contests where you’re placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you’re ranked in the lower levels I’m convinced this game randomly “loosens up” and you’re able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I’m convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game “tightens up” and it’s impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it’s too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I’m getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!

Every day of every round I have to keep on pressing a X. Like STOP. Another thing is that the power ups are so short! They only last like five seconds. I think they could fix that in one of there updates. Oh speaking of updates, I love how they change the setting, but why CHANGE your high score. Like seriously! Come on man. My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

It is so easy to use, and the 4 dollars that I paid for it was so worth it! This beats any other Monopoly app that I have used BY FAR. It lets you get all the same Monopoly experiences as the board game, such as auctions, but the game is way faster! Also, there are absolutely NO ads! It lets you customize the game rules, too! For example, you can change the number of houses you need to have on a property before you can buy a hotel. My favorite thing about this game is the hassle-free games! Just tap a few buttons, and BOOM! You’re playing Monopoly! There’s no organizing money, or dealing with cards, It’s just SO EASY!!!! I mean, if I could, I would give this game 10 STARS!!!!!!

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The “your turn” banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice. The EA version of this game had a terrific animation for the game pieces. Would be nice to see the something similar here.",The dice should never be obstructed.,4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

I wish there were more roles or a imposter chance so you wouldn’t always get crewmate. I also am very mad at how the crewmates just leave when I finally get imposter with my BFF. I think you should also make a new map or an hide and seek map for the people who play hide and seek. Otherwise it’s great! Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win! But also there is a glitch, I join a game with one player (that’s what it says) but it turns out to be full! It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don’t curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters!

The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. 😄 and I’m glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It’s annoying how fast your stars run out. What’s even more annoying, it’s that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you’ve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I’m saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! 😆     Please take this into consideration.

But then the new update with the new chat feature and when I could ONLY use that it became very annoying for me to actually look for what I have to say, and it took too long, then people started thinking that I self report... it’s better off really that I should just say directly what I saw is my personal preference. So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn’t give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it’s fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can’t do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.",So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason.,4,True,learnability,positive,6

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical “offers” they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as “easy, medium, or hard” just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they’re fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge.

I love this game, I’m obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don’t get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn’t work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn’t give it, you can’t get it cause you can’t ask “Proof?” or “Why?”. You also can’t really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can’t. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself. It extremely limits what you can say and how you get info. It just does not work. Please fix this InnerSloth.

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The “your turn” banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice. The EA version of this game had a terrific animation for the game pieces.

I understand that with freedom of speech comes those who use for unsavory acts but the whole point of a mafia/among us type game is to be deceptive or as honest as possible. I don’t know how I’m really supposed to play when all that is said is player names and “lies” or “no” or “idk”. I hope that the devs at least allow for people to change whether or not to have chat wheels in the game, as I could see that helping with the progress of the game even further, with new ideas coming into play like how people thought of hide n seek for it. At the very least, I think that if the devs want the game to come back, because I know a lot of people will leave it because of this, then they should work on ways of allowing people to have they freedom or not with the chat. Inner sloth, if you read this, thanks for all the hard work you have put into among us, and I’m really glad to have played it, but please consider this change that I know others would want along with me.

I love the characters, the season hunts, and challenges. The one thing. The ONE THING that I cannot stand are the super sneakers. I hate how bulky they are and how they make me feel like I’m moving slow. I also can’t stand the magnetic ability in them. Don’t get me wrong, it does come in handy, but when I’m mid-jump and they run out of the little bar thing at the bottom (idk what it’s called), the charge of them if you will, and I’m going over a jump with coins and the sneakers run out and i’m left in the air not getting the remainder of the coins...that makes me so unbelievably annoyed. I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes.

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun. The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it’s all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more!

The game rarely glitched and overall was the best mobile game I’d found in a while. But after this last update I can’t say that anymore. I love the idea of not showing who voted who ( it really helps with the occasional bullies) and I like the point of the update. Next I will say what I would like you to add adding friends, maybe more maps ( I like the ones you have but a big Change like that sound good), no hacking ( it’s still happening just not the full game bug you guys had), and actual bug fixes. Let me explain the last one or why I can’t say I love the game anymore. Earlier today I was playing with my younger sister and teaching her to play, sounds fun right? Well it was but soon after we had to make a new game bc people weren’t able to stay on our game with being kicked off for no reason. So me and her tried making a new game and it basically told us we had been M.I.A when the game hadn’t even loaded yet. Then we gave up. Later that day i by myself tried playing a game and it kept telling me I have an old version of the game even tho it just updated a day before. So that brings us to now. Pease actually do bug fixes and please read this and take note of how your game is extremely glitchy and isn’t a fun game anymore.

This game, it’s pretty decent. I’ll give it its credit. It’s a well made game and well marketed. Here’s the deal. Minecraft has been a game for years and still has multiple unfixed big bugs. It’s not crazy that such a game on a mobile device gets such bugs. When it gets to the point of me having to delete and reinstall the app over and over, it starts to get on your nerves. I’m thirteen btw. I’m just trying to play with my little sister. I spend hours upon hours building her her perfect dream mansion only to one day try to open the app and it crash. This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times. I’ve notified mojang and they just told me to delete and reinstall the app. They SHOULDN’T have to tell me to DELETE the app. All the hard work 😂😓. Anyway, thank you for reading my comment. I do recommend Minecraft. Even though it has its share of bugs, I still love it. I’ve been playing it ever since beta.

BUT I have some requirements. Number one is EMOJIS. We really need some emojis to express how we fell and to make talking with others easier. I mean I’m trying to make faces with text and it doesn’t let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it’s easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I’m not complaining that mobile players get updates later I’m just saying that at the time I’m typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can’t update. Now I don’t know how updates for this game work since I’ve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1. I understand that these things are probably difficult to do but I really think that these would make the game better. But then again I’m not a game creator so I don’t know how this is.

But, I would like to request a feature. Could there be an option to have more intelligent crew mates/impostors in free play? For example: I start up free play and see an option saying “would you like to turn on intelligent mode?” I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode.

Now multiplayer is fun and all especially when I’m winning cuz I’ll have a few thousand and a row of hotels that bankrupt two other players. But then it’s always fun to just flash my wealth around and buy properties from the last player just so that it’s harder for them, but every time I do this (or just if I trade properties for money in general when someone’s bankrupt) it gets me stuck on the keep property mortgaged page. So I click unmorggage. Then I click it again. Then five minutes later I’m still spam clicking the button and I have to leave to solve the problem. I’ve tried everything I could but it always does this. Monopoly’s a great game and all but honestly I’ll probably just delete the game because it’s just annoying and frustrating when I have a hotel on boardwalk, all the railroads, and like 10 other hotels, while the other player has two properties left unmortgaged, then they win because the lousy game crashes on me.

Say if I’ve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn’t use.

It’s super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join’s game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: “Sent 6 pings” or the “unreliable packet source” or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that’s something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask “hey any (insert gender) here?” “What’s ur snap?” “Hey how old are you?” It’s really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it’s later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

What about leaderboards to see other friends or leagues that you’re able to participate in? The menu is so bland, and it is so very clear that a lot more can be added to make it much more engaging and addictive. Personal daily challenges & achievements.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

Likewise, I’m convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game “tightens up” and it’s impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like “Speeding Fine” two or three times in a row, while never pulling “Advance To...” cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that’s not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A “Randomized” mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the “Classic” mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn’t think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn’t have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn’t working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‘Blackstone’? I didn’t even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can’t think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most. Overall really good game!,I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no.,5,True,effectiveness,negative,2

Before I downloaded this app I read all the reviews! Everything everyone said about it is so true, yet you do nothing about it! I think a game should be fun and challenging but not frustrating!

Sad because it could be so much fun! 😕I see the developers still really don’t give a crap. After reading so many complaints on here and the developers never even answer one of them. I am not using my stars on putting up decorations in the kitchen. Dumb! Why have so many rooms when you can’t get into them? Ridiculous! I really only play it when I absolutely have nothing else to do because I’ll never get to really decorate the house. I thought that was the point of the game.

It’s my “go to” favorite.  I’m somewhere around level 1100 or close to it.  Some levels are hard to the point that it gets ridiculous.  Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it’s just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn’t give you much in return.  I mostly just wanted to let people know you don’t have to spend money to win this game...and yes, some of the tasks are eye rolling but....its still a fun game.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don’t have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn’t have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can’t really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

If the game isn’t able to reconnect you quickly enough, you get replaced by an AI and are booted from the game.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don’t make sense. For example, you’ll jump over a barrier and then you’ll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don’t want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road. All in all, the game is great, it just needs some minor improvements and maybe some more challenges to get the player excited.","For example, you’ll jump over a barrier and then you’ll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it.",4,True,reliability,negative,7

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren’t sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don’t take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it’s really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It’s also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It’s like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I’ve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I’m only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

For a company to purchase this game for 2.5 billion dollars and it still be this buggy and have this little content amazes me. I have a realm and pay $8 a month but it’s barely playable. Mobile edition crashes all the time, everything is super laggy when more players join the game. Don’t get me started on the bugs it makes the game worthless. As an owner I can barely access the settings with it bugging out. They have NO customer service only a fake skeleton crew that will never reply to you. I sent an emergency customer service request only to get a reply ONE YEAR LATER. This is one of the greatest ongoing scams of this century. They feed off of children buying skins and maps while doing nothing to progress the game. They will milk it until it’s dry and then cast it aside like a vampire with a used carcass. It’s not the employees fault as I have made friends with them over the years and they are hardworking people who don’t have the resources and support they need. It’s Microsoft’s fault because they just want the money and not the investment. They have left this game with just a few people managing it and it’s a disgrace to the name of business.

But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right? Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad. And the game goes on without me and the server gets full. Then it kicks me out and says “This server is full” I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don’t understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven’t seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I’ve seen it happen to others.Update: I’ve now discovered that the “Automatic role” system is very bad for me. I’ve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it’s rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it’s a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they’re standing near the body.","I really love the concept of this game, it’s very cool!",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don’t even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

Then I landed on chance and received the same card as the first guy “Advance token to Boardwalk”. Now when I was a young boy I was told you’re supposed to put your card in another pile and shuffle them when they are all used up. Or you can keep them in rotation and place the card at the bottom.

It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I’ll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor’s AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode.

On average, I’m only able to by four, maybe five random properties a game, which doesn’t even allow me to make any trades at all with other opponents! In fact, in one of my most recent games I ONLY LANDED ON THREE UN-PURCHASED PROPERTIES THE ENTIRE GAME, AND WAS OUT OF THE GAME RATHER QUICKLY!!!

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun.

It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like “Blah is the imposter!” or “Blah vented!” (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn’t figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don’t say bad words, but it is difficult.

Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it’s not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

I’d love to be able to store it for future use when I have 3 hours to waste playing games. Also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying. I’d like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That’s usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn’t feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I’d rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

One of my biggest complaints is the fact that you cannot do something as little as pull down your notification screen a smidge without being forced to bear a 20 second+ dimmed out “Rejoining game...” screen. That’s ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That’s unacceptable, really. What’s the point in playing a game that’s likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They’re also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. 🙄 Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot. To the Monopoly fans, tread carefully because this game was clearly developed as a cash grab and not to give us the mobile Monopoly we would expect in 2020. The base gameplay is acceptable, but the flaws make the game close to unplayable.",Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode.,1,True,efficiency,negative,3

A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don’t show up. Moving on to the next issue.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend’s game if you could just click ‘join game’ like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can’t control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep?

Now I can’t stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can’t get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files.

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it’ll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage.

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn’t make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It’s super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don’t have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

Real players wouldn’t do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won’t let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it’s fixed though. That doesn’t mean it’s fine though, because if you don’t notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it’s hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can’t avoid it. There are a few others that aren’t as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it’s not free in the first place. No, I don’t want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it’s just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the “end turn” button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose “auction” instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab.

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.",I downloaded Homescapes because of the ads for it I saw on Words With Friends.,3,True,general,positive,5

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don’t know people you play with in random servers it’s fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it’s tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there’s probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don’t have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again. And for the last, it would be nice to add Charles to the stickmin bundle (this isn’t really a problem but it would be cool to have him in UwU💞).

To my mind, there aren’t many ads, they do pop up across the home screen occasionally, but you can X out of those easy enough. The other ads are for rewards, which makes it worth it. The actual game is neat. I like the power ups you can get in game, ESPECIALLY the mystery hoverboard. I wish it’d appear more often. It’s really cool to be able to test out the different powers. If I had to change something, I’d want to make an in game option where if you’re ready to leave the game but don’t want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it’s be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there’d be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it’d have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is. It could be a special event/mission! I hope you take this suggestion seriously, because it’d be AWESOME!!!",The actual game is neat.,5,True,general,positive,5

I loved watching the garden change and feeling I had a say in just how it looked. I even paid attention to Austin’s in-game FB posts and enjoyed when he had visitors. Then...it got harder and harder to pass levels. I have little money to spend so I rarely buy “helps” but I do write reviews when I love a game and tell friends to check it out. I haven’t played Gardenscapes for weeks now—though I sometimes open it up to look at how pretty the garden is and to tell Austin I’m still on vacation and to take care of the house. With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end. I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games—and even that doesn’t get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated.

I know it’s for the safety of younger kids but I’m almost an adult and I’m still stuck with this option. Most people put a fake birthday on the game because they don’t want their real one out there so the update is based off of a majority of fake birthdates so having a limited age is almost pointless because of the inaccuracy of the dates. I think it would be best if instead of the gaming forcing you to use an option based on the date of birth that you put, you have both options in the settings of the game and parents can choose the options for their younger children that way the older people playing can use the option that allows them to talk how they usually would ( before the update) without the quick chat only.

I end having to close the app and reopen it.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can’t because you’re out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don’t have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I’ve won only once in 20 games! And that’s only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being “rigged.” As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as “random.” Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It’s the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

But, it also causes lag sometimes problems connecting and my friend thought it was funny to go on my iPad while I was sleeping change my entire account name and everything and now it costs money to change my name back.

Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend.

For example, when I’m trying to build a house I’d look and see if the cat coming down the road would land on either Baltic Ave or Boardwalk, and the one with the greater % I’d build the house on.

When you join “Online Multiplayer”, and you’re playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you’re paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they’ll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they’ll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they’ll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they’ll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you’re instantly replaced with an AI and there’s no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don’t want to erase all the progress you’ve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: “Online Multiplayer” isn’t online multiplayer. There may be one or two “real” people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn’t, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because “Red sus” I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

But the graphics, the colors, the sequence, the theme, all of it all together is really cute/entertaining for me personally. And I couldn’t bring myself to delete it, so I continued to play and basically to accept the challenge for what it is.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you’ve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there’s no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it’s a fun game, but there’s room for improvement.

One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it’s impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don’t have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don’t ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there’s some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they’ve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard.

I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you’re working on isn’t a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it’s hard.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don’t have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn’t have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can’t really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there. I hope you guys read this and take some of my suggestions into consideration (even thought you won’t because why would you read my crappy review) thank you!

The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it. The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin’s parents.  The sticky situations are called “Austin’s Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don’t mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you’re out of stars, you can’t do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don’t ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","Win in one round, earn one star.",3,True,general,positive,5

They only offer a winter theme and that’s it...and more importantly the app of monopoly should offer a way for you to communicate with other players while actually playing ! Maybe select phrases and emoji icons in order to keep the communication more controlled. It would also be nice to have worldwide competitions amongst all players and win some new game pieces or some type of cool game play feature..and it would allow players to have their own stats and see how many wins and losses and try to pass other players while playing!

It has been about two months. Another problem is that the new update (in my opinion) has made the game look very old and childish. It looks like it is from the 90s. I highly dislike the new style of the game. I also purchased double coins many years ago and now I cannot get it back even when I restore my purchase. I’m not going to waste my time emailing the company because I will not get an answer. The items in the game are also way too expensive.

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn’t work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn’t have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone.

Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to.

I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes.

It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn’t pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can’t even begin to comprehend.

It’s my “go to” favorite.  I’m somewhere around level 1100 or close to it.  Some levels are hard to the point that it gets ridiculous.  Some of the hard levels are easy or perhaps it’s just luck to win them.  I have spent days on a level and get frustrated and then dont play for a while...but i still really enjoy this game.  You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven’t.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don’t win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn’t give you much in return.  I mostly just wanted to let people know you don’t have to spend money to win this game...and yes, some of the tasks are eye rolling but....its still a fun game.

So I saw these worlds you could download that already have houses in them and i thought it would be fun. For example: City Life. It looked really fun to play because you can ride in cars and there are a lot of different buildings you can go in. So it said I could buy it for $5.99 and I did, I played on it with my sisters for hours. I really liked it. This went on for a couple of weeks, but then one day it said it was locked and I had to buy City Life all over again, i was very mad. I already changed stuff in that world and I didn’t even know that If i rebought it, all my stuff would still be there. I was willing to rebuy because I thought it wouldn’t happen again and it was just an error Minecraft made. I played on it for an hour or two and I turned it off and didn’t touch it. The next day, I was excited to play on City Life again, but this time I was furious. It had been only 14 hours and it’s already saying I have to rebuy it again. I couldn’t stand it, i wasn’t going to buy it for the 3rd time in 3 weeks. Now I’m here hoping that this review will change something and I won’t have to pay for it EVER AGAIN.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

I love the characters, the season hunts, and challenges. The one thing. The ONE THING that I cannot stand are the super sneakers. I hate how bulky they are and how they make me feel like I’m moving slow. I also can’t stand the magnetic ability in them. Don’t get me wrong, it does come in handy, but when I’m mid-jump and they run out of the little bar thing at the bottom (idk what it’s called), the charge of them if you will, and I’m going over a jump with coins and the sneakers run out and i’m left in the air not getting the remainder of the coins...that makes me so unbelievably annoyed. I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes. My brother is the same way, and so are many other people. I want something better, or make it so the sneakers magnetic ability don’t stop picking up the coins when i’m mid-air.

And if you’re under 13 or whatever age it is, it won’t even let you chose your own name! What’s up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks.

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred.

I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won’t unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the “loading terrain” screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

The only customization is being able to select what you play as before a game and what map you use, but what about having your own profile and being able to search up other people? What about leaderboards to see other friends or leagues that you’re able to participate in? The menu is so bland, and it is so very clear that a lot more can be added to make it much more engaging and addictive. Personal daily challenges & achievements.

I played it everywhere and I enjoyed it very much. I have seen some harsh reviews on the update  and I see what you were going for when you made the update but seems a little rushed. It also is a little laggy but barely. I’m very confused on how to work the game with so much going on with the new update. I am slowly adapting to it but I really think that you should change it back to the original version. Although I do understand that kids do play and that might be the reason you did it but it’s way to complicated for them. I think you guy wanted to spice things up and I think some people like it but I could be nice if you would change it back to the old version or at least I have a control in the settings to change it to any version you want. I understand what you were doing and I’m giving a four star rating because I love this game update or not it’s just great. Besides the issues of the update it’s amazing. I just want to let everyone know that you shouldn’t be so harsh the creators just wanted to please you and possibly made a few mistakes in our opinion. ❤️,Besides the issues of the update it’s amazing.,4,True,general,positive,5

Can you also maybe make it where you can favorite lobby. Like there can be a button like a heart or something and you can go to like a tab and go to your favorite lobby’s. Do you also think you can it where when you die you can a have an overview of the whole map. But only when you die so it’s fair. Do you also think you can make something called “watch mode” when you can watch other people play games and you can be I there body’s and watch as they play and overview the map.

The levels are hard, but they want you to continuously spend money on coins etc.. to try to win or put in an ad about other versions of this game.  It gets frustrating and you want to put the game down and never return.  Let’s say you’re rewarded with an hour or more of free play,  it ticks down from that minute instead of letting you go in and play on your own schedule and let it tick down.  Some of us work for a living and may play during our lunch or break, if you activate the free time, it is ticking down and over when you are off work and can play.  The creators want you to acquire other versions/themes of the game.. if they’re like this one.. no way I’d get them.  Funny that in the garden today while sweeping the butler says how he like to keep the dust out of the carpets there and keeps a clean house ( same thing he says in the house.. you should change the text to match the scenes)  the guitar is in the house, but it magically appeared for him to sit on a bench and play it while chastising me about how hard the game must be for me to play.  when you lose each life, the look on characters face is like you’re a failure... this doesn’t encourage you to play, you want to avoid that look like the plague.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else’s review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

However I did find more cons than pros. Let’s start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter’s job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with “Confirm Ejects” and “Visual Tasks” on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says “(insert anything here) was not An Imposter” or “was An Imposter”. With it being the imposter’s job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it’s okay if they leave the hard r out but it’s not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

Why it’s A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you “ the among us savers “ are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can’t say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this “well we also have it we’re if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say “ and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of “speech” would most likely not like this but then again I’m not them. If you feel like I’m wrong then I’m wrong if you feel like I’m right then I’m right but I’m just shooting out there that this “update” might or should I say will effect this games success in a good way or bad way and if it does effect it in a bad way then at least you would know why.

If so I would recommend picking up your phone and download Subway Surfers. I love to just sit back and run on the train tracks for hours. What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

I LOVE IT!!!,"I’ve been playing Subway Surfers since I was a little kid and practically grew up with it. Even now I think it’s such a fun and exciting game. It definitely can help pass time. Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn’t get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I’m correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don’t know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have “hype” I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

For instance, the load in screen could have small ribbons or stats or banner that shows that either this player has won quite a bit and will be a challenge or that they have accomplished certain challenges, such as winning multiple games in a row.

I’d love to be able to store it for future use when I have 3 hours to waste playing games. Also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying. I’d like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That’s usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn’t feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I’d rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

It’s so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you’d be talking instead of typing through a screen. You’d be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you’re playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

I’ve literally spent 7 days clicking on the app, attempting the level a few times, failing, and not being able to move on with the game. I’m so fed up, I’ve had this app sitting here for a week and haven’t made any progress. I’ve even had friends try to beat the level, and other people who have played games similar to this. When you first see the level you think “oh, easy” but as you go on, you only have so few moves to collect 40 yellow and 40 blue and about 85% of the map is covered in boxes. You only have 20 moves to rid the map of enough boxes to get more yellow and blue on the screen and only what’s left to collect forty of each color! I know these games aren’t meant to be easy.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn’t enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called “Hard Levels” makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it’s extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It’s a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don’t give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try.

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I’m deleted the game today because I don’t spend “real” money on games, especially when there isn’t a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it’s 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn’t that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it’s not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to.

Although it’s a very well made very fun to play game, there’s some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you’re the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media’s out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It’s kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn’t get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it’s just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you’re bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you’re friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you’re working on isn’t a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it’s hard.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it’s now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can’t play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it’s March and it still hasn’t come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can’t let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it’s my bad wifi, but that’s not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

Every download the only thing that changes are a new map, which is basically the same layout as every other map, and an overpriced character. Maybe you can add some more interesting updates like a railway crossing with another train intersecting like a cross and the player has to jump through a hole in one of the cars. Or maybe a car crossroad where the cars are driving over the track and the player has to jump on the cars. How about a more interesting above-ground section when you use the jetpack so you can dodge different objects such as trees and parked bicycles.

But it wasn’t always that way...if you find and defeat the forden (A small mob that is is visible but will fade if you look at it.) If you find the power source that causes this mob to fade you cow destroy it. That mob will drop something called the Fax enchantment to gloves (which y’all should add too) and you touch something the whole world will spring with life. Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don’t make sense. For example, you’ll jump over a barrier and then you’ll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don’t want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.
