It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous. The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.","Honestly, I love this game.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I noticed that I would strive to get my pink and dark blue set every game, but nobody would land on them once I added houses and/or hotels. I noticed that they would skate right by and all of a sudden I keep going to jail when no player had been the entire game. After 30+ games, you start to notice trends. Today was kind of the breaking point for me when an AI owned Park Place and nobody owned Boardwalk. This was the beginning of the game and neither I nor the 3 AI‚Äôs had more than 2 or 3 properties and nobody was close to a set. I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent and am very good at recognizing patterns. Not saying it‚Äôs rigged, but adding this to the difficulty level makes the game incredibly frustrating and not fun to play.","After 30+ games, you start to notice trends.",3,True,general,positive,5

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can‚Äôt really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the ‚Äúwinner!‚Äù. Ticks you off especially after spending an hour with idiots that want to make the same trade every single turn!

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them.

But then I tried public games.It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

I LOVE IT!!!,"I‚Äôve been playing Subway Surfers since I was a little kid and practically grew up with it. Even now I think it‚Äôs such a fun and exciting game. It definitely can help pass time. Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

Absolutely horrible. Anytime I add an AI in the game, whether I‚Äôm playing with other real players or just a lobby of computers, the AI is seemingly always rolling favorably. It‚Äôs obvious that the computer players cheat via the dice roll. There have been countless games that both me and my brothers have played where the AI player outlasts us because it gets favorable rolls. Even when a whole side of color schemes has been bought up and houses/hotels applied, they always seem to skip over those spaces until the game comes down to human player and AI. This is one of the most frustrating things I‚Äôve ever encountered on a cell phone game because I‚Äôm an avid monopoly player and I‚Äôm well aware that the dice doesn‚Äôt favor anybody at anytime. The math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before I can enjoy this game. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY unless you have people around you and can play locally.

I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

It was really fun just trying to get the highest run and the biggest amount of coins. But then, a couple of years after the app came into being, it's levels changed up. It gained new challenges and new characters which did help the game but that classic opening was almost completely gone. I come back a few years later and they are still doing the tour. I mean how long does a tour around the world really take? And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same. There is an ad after almost every run. If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away. It made my experience worse. I'm sorry if you really like this game but I can't accept a game that has taken the social media route of selling their customers to the ad companies.",There is an ad after almost every run.,2,True,general,negative,5

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game! Sorry I couldn‚Äôt give it a 5, but I will if you fix the issues ü•∫. Keep making great games!",It makes it worse that they can get really expensive.,4,True,cost,negative,1

The second thing I enjoy about this game is that you don‚Äôt have to basically buy yourself into enjoying this app, since there‚Äôs a lot of games out there that make you spend so much real money to enjoy the game. There are a lot of things in this game that you can spend real money on, but you certainly don‚Äôt have to buy them. I personally don‚Äôt spend money on games so I was very content with this. One of the things I don‚Äôt enjoy that much are like the bouncy shoe things, I know this is really minor but it kills me when I could‚Äôve gotten a lot further, what I‚Äôm talking about it sometimes when I‚Äôm wearing the bouncy shoe things I jump too high and bump into the bridge thing and die, which is kind of annoying.

What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend.

Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have.

If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please. I also just deleted the app. I have no patience for things like this.

If the game isn‚Äôt able to reconnect you quickly enough, you get replaced by an AI and are booted from the game. Additionally, the animations when you purchase property, make trades, or even roll take way too long. Wish there was a way to tap through it to speed up the process.

A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens.

I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often.

All my games just so happen to go the same way.  At first, because the AI is on easy mode, I to great! I‚Äôm usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls. This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI‚Äôs came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. ‚ÄúWhich happened consecutively‚Äù",I‚Äôm usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls.,3,True,general,positive,5

It got to the point where I can accurately predict my rolls. If I own 80% of the board, they will only land on the other 20% and that happens 100% of the time. The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren‚Äôt fair, they‚Äôre only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It‚Äôs laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It‚Äôs insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game.

Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion! My daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home. I can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden. I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with? Otherwise, I love the gameplay. Just stick to the idea of home renovation instead of branching to other story lines for so long.

As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy.

So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report. And for those who have never had the game, I really suggest this to anyone of any gender or age.

I wish there were more roles or a imposter chance so you wouldn‚Äôt always get crewmate. I also am very mad at how the crewmates just leave when I finally get imposter with my BFF. I think you should also make a new map or an hide and seek map for the people who play hide and seek. Otherwise it‚Äôs great! Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win! But also there is a glitch, I join a game with one player (that‚Äôs what it says) but it turns out to be full! It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don‚Äôt curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters! Also I tried to buy a mini crewmate, but it didn‚Äôt let me, I was really disappointed because all my other friends have mini crewmates and Christmas hats!

There‚Äôs a story line yes, but honestly the stories end quicker than u can finish a level. Homescape is still a good game. Matching mansions is good and requires less stars to complete tasks.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game. Yes, I know how ridiculous that sounds but, there are people swearing in the chat, and especially when there is a hacker at the moment.

Quick chat just makes the game even more confusing it limits what you get to say. I know the editors of this game probably thought it was a smart idea because people were being mean and saying swearwords to each other but it‚Äôs a really bad idea because, it is more confusing than when I first got this game. I would love it if they removed the quick chat. And plus people are entering the game with their name as ‚Äúme‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù to beat the System. So you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there‚Äôs a new player in the game that doesn‚Äôt even know how to chat. When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn‚Äôt want to see swearwords or if they wanted to.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like. I recommend Homescapes to everyone who likes to play games like this to take a break from your every day Life. Very enjoyable.,I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

This game, it‚Äôs pretty decent. I‚Äôll give it its credit. It‚Äôs a well made game and well marketed. Here‚Äôs the deal. Minecraft has been a game for years and still has multiple unfixed big bugs. It‚Äôs not crazy that such a game on a mobile device gets such bugs. When it gets to the point of me having to delete and reinstall the app over and over, it starts to get on your nerves. I‚Äôm thirteen btw. I‚Äôm just trying to play with my little sister. I spend hours upon hours building her her perfect dream mansion only to one day try to open the app and it crash. This time the app completely crashes every time it loads. It sends me right back to my home screen. Seriously. Someone help me out here. These sort of bugs have happened multiple times. I‚Äôve notified mojang and they just told me to delete and reinstall the app. They SHOULDN‚ÄôT have to tell me to DELETE the app. All the hard work üòÇüòì. Anyway, thank you for reading my comment. I do recommend Minecraft. Even though it has its share of bugs, I still love it. I‚Äôve been playing it ever since beta.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think.",4,True,general,positive,5

I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren‚Äôt enough either. In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks. This game ends up being a days at most because of demand for boosters/coins to the cost ratio. I see this company fizzling out soon because of this. It‚Äôs a shame. They have a good game. If the reward system worked like Zynga games then they might last.",In other games if you spent $20 you would be set for a couple weeks.,2,True,enjoyability,negative,4

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

So here's what happened: I was playing Subway Surfers for most of the day, during car rides and stuff, whenever I had a little free time. But on this day I just couldn't die. I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline.

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don‚Äôt expect to win. I‚Äôve won once because AI don‚Äôt get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use.

Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level.",4,True,effectiveness,negative,2

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

I know this was for a good reason and it was meant to make things easier, but it really doesn‚Äôt. Maybe if you let people type in some things but not everything like ‚Äòyou are an idiot!‚Äô that would be double awesome!!

Also, since the update happened there have been SOOOOOO many glitches and I can almost never rejoin a game because it turns black and I have to swipe out and then join a new game every time. I will still play this game because I really love the idea of it though!!

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

If you‚Äôve seen any ad for this game then you‚Äôve probably saw the ‚Äúpull the the pins‚Äù type of gameplay presented to draw you in. That‚Äôs NOT what this game is. That type of gameplay is so small & almost insignificant that it‚Äôs pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising. If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars. But I think A LOT of people will go into this game expecting one thing and getting another, and I think that is a significant knock against the game.","What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay.",2,True,general,positive,5

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.","However, the game is hard to play on my own time.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

The point of every game is to be challenging, what‚Äôs the fun if it isn‚Äôt. This game however takes challenging to a whole other level! As I‚Äôve said it other post, this is not a game of skill. It‚Äôs all based if the game allows the pieces to fall, the boosters to point in the direction needed to win. A blind monkey can play this game because it‚Äôs all luck, like a slot machine. Most levels, no matter if they are regular, hard, or super hard take 2-3 lives to beat. I will say, I have on very rare occasion beat a level on the first attempt.

One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns.

Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

Second, i like how we have the option to play the QUICK mode since this game is naturally takes forever (which is nice somehow) to end. Third and on the bad side, i wish there is a way for an actual chat rather than the pre wording that is not even applicable for every scenario. EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game. That will actually make the experience more real rather than it‚Äôs always random guest and while playing with random people, you can‚Äôt add any of those players per say. Overall nice game.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

I have been playing this game since I was 4, and, once I looked at my old world, and memories flowed through my brain, Remembered everything. It brought tears to my eyes. But, it also brought tears to my eyes when there was a glitch. Which caused a lot of personal anger, and disappointment. So, I was playing and all of a sudden, when I was walking forward, and it wouldn't let me move, it was like, when you make a new world, you can make it infinite, flat, or old, it was like it cut the world off. But, when I went towards the glitch but went left or right, and kept going... going... going.  And literally 2 minutes later, the lag would ""end"" and I could go forward on my horse again. It was like there was invisible blocks that kept going and going and going and going. This was really disappointing, and it really upsetted me when I was playing with my cousins and I kept having to log off and on and it was so weird, the glitch/lag LITERALLY moved to a different spot, I made this fence, and it went there, then there was one at the mountain river, then, at he front of my barn, then, left of the mini barn, then, literally ALL around my whole acre of barn land for my horses, this was super upsetting, can you guys fix this for the next bug update?

I downloaded the latest update, got on it to check out all of the new features they added, but it went into super-lag mode, and won't really allow me to even legitimately play it. Usually, after trying to play for 30 seconds or so, the app will kick me, along with my iPod heating up A LOT. This is the only device I really have to play Minecraft PE on. So, I would really appreciate a fix in the next update that will improve the game efficiency-wise. And, next time there is a big update that will lag older devices, don't allow those devices to be updated. At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still. Will take a few seconds to work, and device still heats. Only reason not one star is because I didn't technically review the update features.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that.

If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars.

To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time.

So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

But I don‚Äôt usually spend any money on apps unless I know I‚Äôll use it. Well, I played a few days straight while stuck at home for a bit at Christmas. The AI is ok but it was playing against other people I was looking forward to! I won the first two times and thought that I was gonna really love playing this. As I played more and more I noticed some frustrating things. I don‚Äôt have to win all the time and make enough mistakes to know why I‚Äôve lost. But the inconsistency on the dice roll for all players is a predictable algorithm with no actual randomness. When I pay $4 I don‚Äôt except the world but I would have liked the opportunity to earn thru winning, other boards and pieces. No leaderboard or way to keep stats in this digital world was a surprise. I‚Äôm hoping for change as my thoughts seem to be repeated over and over again in the reviews.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

To my mind, there aren‚Äôt many ads, they do pop up across the home screen occasionally, but you can X out of those easy enough. The other ads are for rewards, which makes it worth it. The actual game is neat. I like the power ups you can get in game, ESPECIALLY the mystery hoverboard. I wish it‚Äôd appear more often. It‚Äôs really cool to be able to test out the different powers. If I had to change something, I‚Äôd want to make an in game option where if you‚Äôre ready to leave the game but don‚Äôt want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it‚Äôs be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there‚Äôd be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it‚Äôd have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

Why do u I have to play 9 games just to hang pictures?? Games such as Homescape, matching mansions, gardenscape etc...all have a visual that your job is to figure out how to fix the room. Putting ppl under the assumption that that‚Äôs all they have to do with some games involved. It‚Äôs misleading to give this impression when in fact you are basically candy crushing it out and spending little time ‚Äúfixing things‚Äù and more time playing so that u can fix things. There‚Äôs a story line yes, but honestly the stories end quicker than u can finish a level. Homescape is still a good game. Matching mansions is good and requires less stars to complete tasks.

The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. üòÑ and I‚Äôm glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time.

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that‚Äôs not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report.

I‚Äôve been playing since I was like 5, and the game has never failed to produce quality entertainment. But this, it was just sad to say the least.             It lags, the graphics are childish, and the whole update was a mess. When changing from the character section to the board section I now have to wait for it to load, that didn‚Äôt use to happen.

Subway Surfers by Killow is just the app to get.  To start with I like all the powerups.  A powerup is a thing that you can get that can help you get more coins.  I like the jetpack powerup because it gives you lots of coins without the police officer chasing you.  I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.","For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two.",2,True,safety,positive,8

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool!

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely.

Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

All in all one could do a lot worse, if you can manage to avoid spending real money on an app, intend to use this game merely to entertain yourself as a time killing option, or simply don‚Äôt mind spending real money and enjoy these types of games, then this is at least a 3 out 5, in my opinion it would easily be a 4 or 5 out of 5 if the game didn‚Äôt drag out every little detail possible while exploiting potential monetary gains.     However, this is 2020 and unless you live in a country where micro transaction laws exist, then you‚Äôre completely use to the modern manner of app/console/computer gaming where product quality and consumer satisfaction have taken a far back seat to profitable gains, because let‚Äôs face it, business innovation has died and flogging a dead horse for everything one can get out of it is the only skill modern business has left.","Most of the reviews I‚Äôve read have been accurately stated, this game is a typical game while at the same time being uniquely special.",3,True,general,positive,5

When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave. Teaming is a HUGE issue in the game with entire groups of friends outing the imposters as soon as the game starts. The emergency button is used too often... or often use it to SAY HI!!! I find it frustrating when trying to play the game. PLEASE ADD A VOICE CHAT OPTION!!! This would make the game so much easier and I feel that it would defer toxic language because you can hear a person‚Äôs voice. Also, many bugs ranging from, game connection error to animation glitches. PLEASE FIX THIS!!!!

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely.

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The ‚Äúyour turn‚Äù banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties.

Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

It‚Äôs grown over the years, and the world tour was a big, nice hit. I would recommend this to anyone bored, especially during these crazy times. But I have a few suggestions. Can the world tour travel to Malawi, Africa? My dad grew up there, and I would love to see how you design it. Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people. We have no way of knowing that right off the bat, this is a large issue.

It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times.

I could be wrong, maybe it‚Äôs impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don‚Äôt have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don‚Äôt ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there‚Äôs some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they‚Äôve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard.

But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate!

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard.",4,True,general,negative,5

I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing! Trust me, you won‚Äôt regret getting it!!!üíïüíï",There are also a few glitches that can be annoying.,5,True,security,negative,9

In the actual game you have to play a matching game and place furniture down.      The good thing about this game is that it is super fun and not to hard to play. It has easy instructions on how to play and what to do. I also like how I have a choice of three things to pick from when I‚Äôm picking furniture,rugs,wallpaper,exc.

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing!

I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game!

The levels with soap bubbles or oil spreading while you try to keep it at bay while solving the actual puzzle is ridiculous and next to impossible. Only getting 5 tries at a time to solve a puzzle like that (unless you get a random surprise ‚Äúreward‚Äù of 30-60 mins, or a few hours of unlimited play) is frustrating beyond words. ESPECIALLY when, if you don‚Äôt have time to stop your day to use that surprise time, it goes away. The clock on that time should stop when you log off to live life, and continue when you have time to return to the game.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.","However, like all games, this one has some problems.",4,True,security,negative,9

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning.

This time (since I re-downloaded) I‚Äôve gotten a lot more into the game, collecting the characters and boards, and completing the challenges. It‚Äôs a lot of fun!There is one thing that I would love to see. When you get a power up like the coin magnet or the bouncy shoes a little flash of light shoots out! Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

I remember surprise Friday or Friday surprise, but then it stopped. Until an exception- Surprise Saturday. Ah yes. I remember why polar bears were added in the game, and the reason. Jeb‚Äôs wife (I think it‚Äôs Jeb‚Äôs..) liked polar bears, so that‚Äôs why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free. All this time it‚Äôs been downloaded in my cloud storage, so I never had to buy it. (Heh) This game never stops improving. But of course, I‚Äôm more of a Java version myself, of course. The days of me and the boys, staying up all night, gaming, building whatever we could. I also remember the day when Microsoft bought Mojang, or did they buy Minecraft? Anyways. The first minecon was about 30 people, mostly Notches‚Äô family. The good ol days of Minecraft. A few things could be changed though. The shooting speed of skeletons is very high, I dislike that, I have some other things, but I don‚Äôt want to keep you from doing your jobs. Thanks so much for these amazing 12 years of Minecraft!

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits. If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I‚Äôd even consider paying for that.",I deleted it after reaching level 20.,2,True,learnability,negative,6

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point.

I played when hunger bars didn't exist. When it would be that if you move in water you swim up, when mobs could attack you from underwater or well let's say I was really deep into the ocean. The zombie just attacks me if I am under it. When you couldn't well screw it I just played for a long time let's say that. A suggestion? The launcher like choosing a mcpe version you like.  Just like java. Also please add the option to remove features and mobs without turning cheats on. Let's say I removed drowned. Cheats don't turn off. If I remove all hostile mobs. Never.

This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren‚Äôt fair, they‚Äôre only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It‚Äôs laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4?

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

Before the update was released, people were chatting very easily on the game and I, including others, had no problem with the chat before hand. Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want. This option can give people the chance to communicate better with others. Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were. Discussing who the imposter is a pain because you basically have no clue who the imposter might be because no one uses the new chat.

This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI‚Äôs came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. ‚ÄúWhich happened consecutively‚Äù",The other player is generally just as good.,3,True,general,positive,5

The graphics, gameplay, and everything overall is amazing! I was also thinking of some things that could be added. This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.","As you play the game, things get harder pretty fast.",2,True,enjoyability,negative,4

This game has too many bugs and too few features. Online Multiplayer never works, they‚Äôve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game. The animation is also way too long and it‚Äôs been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers‚Äô minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I‚Äôve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash.

The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week.

What I love about this game is how they make it have a really cool theme. The characters are all so cool and at the start You are spray painting and the police come running after you. Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for. I also hate how all you do in the game is run on train tracks with a few of the same obstacles in your way. I just sometimes wish there could be more obstacles or Like different courses you take.

Thank you among us for your consideration for younger people by making the safety automated responses, but it‚Äôs really not doing it for me.  And please patch the glitch.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",Considering we are his aunts.,5,True,general,positive,5

Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day. The update however.... I just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better. The controls are still a bit whacked out. It seems to have a hard time figuring out that you are trying to move left when in midair. Always seems to want to roll or jump instead. I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue. Another one where I have to clear so many hurdles, and then another where I have to run through bushes, don‚Äôt seem to work if I currently have a power up. Would be nice to have these fixed!Keep up the great work. Thanks and cheers!","Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day.",5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Or they still follow you and explode in creative mode in the MCPE I enjoyed. Keyword: enjoyed. This is supposed to be portable? Hence ""Pocket Edition"" but now if I play it without wi-if it crashes. I played when hunger bars didn't exist. When it would be that if you move in water you swim up, when mobs could attack you from underwater or well let's say I was really deep into the ocean. The zombie just attacks me if I am under it. When you couldn't well screw it I just played for a long time let's say that. A suggestion? The launcher like choosing a mcpe version you like.  Just like java. Also please add the option to remove features and mobs without turning cheats on. Let's say I removed drowned. Cheats don't turn off. If I remove all hostile mobs. Never.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don‚Äôt have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast. Definitely recommend.","And B.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

Please, please, PLEASE REMOVE THEM!!! One more thing, the new characters. They are so expensive!!! Please make them cheaper. If you don‚Äôt have, let‚Äôs say, about 400,000 coins and that‚Äôs how much a character you really want your not going to be able to get it because it‚Äôs so expensive. You can‚Äôt earn that much in a month. Soon it disappears because the month‚Äôs over and your super bummed out. So you have to pay real money for coins and I don‚Äôt like that.

If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing!

And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side.

As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game!

The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

But my favorite part has to be the soundtrack. Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

The main thing that made my review so low, is the amount of effort it takes to play with other players. Everyone has to have the same version, and the only simple way to join someone's local server is if you are connected to the same WiFi. If you aren't, you MUST sign into Minecraft using your X-Box account, which for a while I didn't have. Now that I have signed in though. I'm now finding out that I have to pay for realms, the add friends, and play with them.                Again, there is nothing wrong with the game or the graphics, infact I really love that part, but I find it quite boring to play on your own, which is really the only option usless your willing to pay to play with friends every month.

Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars.

If you spam click a property you want to mortgage then you lose money until you can‚Äôt click it anymore. When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice. I am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings. It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool.

And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That‚Äôs usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day.

Everyone has to have the same version, and the only simple way to join someone's local server is if you are connected to the same WiFi.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion! My daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home. I can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden. I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with?

Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road. All in all, the game is great, it just needs some minor improvements and maybe some more challenges to get the player excited.","They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key.",4,True,general,positive,5

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

It was very frustrating and I find it completely unfair that they would make you chose where to keep your progress. Especially since this has NEVER happened. The app also gave terrible explanations on what it would do given each option. This was extremely disheartening since I had spent a while doing the wordy weekend hunt and the token run. This app SERIOUSLY needs to start making better updates and not making the game worse. I‚Äôm extremely upset and will no longer be playing the game.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with. To sum: I‚Äôm really glad Among Us is enjoying its popularity, I just wish they‚Äôd fix it.","And there are game-ending graphical errors, too.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly. Once again, don‚Äôt waste your money and time on this app until they start making further improvements and changes to it.","Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them.",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way. Make farms for food, enchant your weapons, and explore villages. There is so much more to do! I‚Äôve played this since I was 4 years old and I still do! It‚Äôs AWESOME! If people hate on Minecraft, then I‚Äôm very disappointed in them. Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year‚Äôs Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I‚Äôm always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can‚Äôt wait for the new nether update coming! It‚Äôs advanced the nether A LOT! It‚Äôs just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it‚Äôs VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

But I don‚Äôt like how we have to do stupid tasks like ‚Äúcall someone‚Äù for up to 6 stars!! We don‚Äôt get enough coins for winning levels! Also when you get into the game more, it takes so much longer to finish a day, it‚Äôll be like 6% closer to rewards when you win a level. Also I don‚Äôt like how we only have five lives. I feel like we should have more lives than only 5! The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

I mean of all the the video games, why did my first one have to be this? Well, I actually got introduced by my classmates , whom have recently discovered the game. When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it‚Äôs really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point. No sense continuing if I already know it‚Äôs a dead match.",Power ups can be hit or miss at the start.,2,True,general,positive,5

What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",It‚Äôs ultimately a great game.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It was really fun just trying to get the highest run and the biggest amount of coins. But then, a couple of years after the app came into being, it's levels changed up. It gained new challenges and new characters which did help the game but that classic opening was almost completely gone. I come back a few years later and they are still doing the tour. I mean how long does a tour around the world really take? And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same. There is an ad after almost every run. If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away.

But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do.

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven‚Äôt been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

That price is more content.

Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched.

Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

It‚Äôs just so fun and addicting. I just got it about three weeks ago and I haven‚Äôt stopped playing since. Although it‚Äôs a very well made very fun to play game, there‚Äôs some things that I think would be cool to add either to among us or among us 2. 1. There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4. Hackers and exploiters should be automatically banned from playing. Maybe you could install a thing that detects their programming and stuff? They ruin the game a lot. Other than that, this game is amazing! Definitely game of the year.

It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining!

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps.

To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet). I‚Äôve already spent $60 on coins/boosters, & I‚Äôve only been playing 2 weeks. Not going to spend anymore $ on this (even though I enjoy it) simply on principle. The rewards for levels are not anywhere close to what they should be, & the amounts you get for what you pay for aren‚Äôt enough either.

When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do.,5,True,general,positive,5

Not that they‚Äôre not working extra hard to make you do it... When I started playing, it was fun because I always had a chance to win. The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!!

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

I was playing a new survival world and killing zombies from a spawner in a cave right next to where I was crafting some things, out of nowhere I get attacked, thinking I was probably crafting too long and just forgot to check if anything was sneaking up on me i turn around and see two zombies approaching, no big deal I take care of them and I get attacked again and turn around and see nothing, I was confused and checked for any zombies but there was nothing to be seen and i kept being attacked and backed into a corner and got killed. Of course I was a little angry and went back for my things but allthat was left out of my entire inventory was my armor almost all broken when before it was all at least above half and immediately i got attacked again and killed two times after.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because ‚ÄúRed sus‚Äù I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

Can the world tour travel to Malawi, Africa? My dad grew up there, and I would love to see how you design it. Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta.

This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes? Are they replaced with an AI? If so, why doesn‚Äôt it tell me that I‚Äôm playing AI? Is the game freezing from and idle player? If so, can there be a boot timer?

A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions.

As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.","Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough.",3,True,general,negative,5

And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it‚Äôs free on mobile, is so nice, and it‚Äôs one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I‚Äôm excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!

The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can‚Äôt get all the characters.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits. If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I‚Äôd even consider paying for that.","There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear.",2,True,cost,negative,1

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

It seems once you pass a certain level the puzzles of course become get more difficult but they also seem to give the game an unfair advantage over the player. As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective. Where on prior levels you can get a few boosters and they could help you win the level, but later it takes more than triple the amount of boosters to pass the level and they don‚Äôt seem to be as powerful. Some levels are almost not passable without spending actual money to buy enough boosters so you can pass it or unless you just get lucky and pieces fall just right.

Only receiving 60 coins for a puzzle it took 20 times to pass.Making it feel almost not worth all the times you had to play to pass the single puzzle.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration. The game would be much more entertaining and exciting if I didn‚Äôt give up so much on the game. Thank you üêòüêòüêò",Not amazing but it‚Äôs good.,3,True,general,positive,5

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing!

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point.

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing!

They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out.

I wish that more of the gold you win for beating each level went to you instead of into your piggy bank, that is very frustrating!! But here I am still playing. I might have to delete it to spare my own piggy bank. ***I finally had to delete it*** I refuse to throw away any more money on something so frivolous but kept getting stuck on these ridiculously hard levels with no helps and not enough gold to buy any more. :( they really need to lower the cost of things and give you more gold when you win a level.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad. Otherwise, fun game!","However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game.",4,True,effectiveness,positive,2

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

Second game number 3 landed on Baltic pl , which got hoteled early because number 1 got sets and $ every turn. Not kidding and then 2 & 3 landed on his properties most turns. Number 1 would skate past anything coating. Landed in Go to collect $400 almost ever time while number 3 landed on Baltic or the next square for income tax. I‚Äôm all for fun, but it‚Äôs not balanced. It takes the fun out of it because it‚Äôs not fair. And before you say it can happen. I‚Äôm 53 and not a poor sport, it doesn‚Äôt happen that ‚Äòluckily‚Äô. We‚Äôre trying a different one of us in number 1 spot today. I‚Äôll update later.  Please please please fix this.

The day after I redownloaded it and already played it it would not load. I would leave it for ten minutes and it would still not load. I emailed the company and they never got back to me. It has been about two months. Another problem is that the new update (in my opinion) has made the game look very old and childish. It looks like it is from the 90s. I highly dislike the new style of the game. I also purchased double coins many years ago and now I cannot get it back even when I restore my purchase. I‚Äôm not going to waste my time emailing the company because I will not get an answer. The items in the game are also way too expensive. It took me almost 3 weeks of playing for about 45 minutes a day to get the hoverboard that I wanted. I will change my rating if the company will take this review into consideration and realize that many people are not a fan of the new update and other features, especially all the bugs that the new update has.",I emailed the company and they never got back to me.,2,True,reliability,negative,7

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

I can‚Äôt ever find the normal nether biome and eventually I give up and create a copy of the world in creative and /locate fortress. As usual, the nearest fortress is thousands and thousands of blocks away, hidden inside a mound of netherack. Because that‚Äôs where I was going to think to look obviously. I never had these problems in the original update, but the latest update ruined minecraft in entirety. And no i‚Äôm not a noob or a bad player, because I have been playing pocket edition since 2013 and I have a world with full netherite gear, a villager farm, and a gigantic sugarcane farm.

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn‚Äôt require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you‚Äôre placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you‚Äôre ranked in the lower levels I‚Äôm convinced this game randomly ‚Äúloosens up‚Äù and you‚Äôre able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I‚Äôm convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game ‚Äútightens up‚Äù and it‚Äôs impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level.

It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year‚Äôs Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft!

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this.

It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun.

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week.

Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play.

I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

Putting ppl under the assumption that that‚Äôs all they have to do with some games involved. It‚Äôs misleading to give this impression when in fact you are basically candy crushing it out and spending little time ‚Äúfixing things‚Äù and more time playing so that u can fix things. There‚Äôs a story line yes, but honestly the stories end quicker than u can finish a level. Homescape is still a good game. Matching mansions is good and requires less stars to complete tasks.

I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that‚Äôs playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent.

Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.

But then the new update with the new chat feature and when I could ONLY use that it became very annoying for me to actually look for what I have to say, and it took too long, then people started thinking that I self report... it‚Äôs better off really that I should just say directly what I saw is my personal preference. So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it‚Äôs fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot. And then some of us would rather play Roblox, Minecraft, GTA, that sort of stuff instead.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.","Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish.",3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

On another note it would be beneficial to add a friends list feature so you can play with others you meet online as well as people you know in person. Also I‚Äôm not a fan of the chat situation. I feel like an open chat forum would allow for more dexterity in the game.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.",This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked.,3,True,general,negative,5

This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

It is very entertaining any enjoyable to collect new characters, hover boards, daily challenge items, etc. I can‚Äôt stop playing it! Although it is very neat and fun to play, there are some things that I think should be taken note of. First of all, when I‚Äôm on the main screen on the game, I‚Äôm about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins. Later on I looked on the app and a new character was in, and was 100,000.

This extra step should not be necessary. The other reason I am writing this four stars is because of the AI players sometimes make a terrible trading deal, where one AI ends up with a full street and ready to build houses, where the other is still needing another street, so basically getting the short end of the stick. Dumb moves like that typically put one AI player way ahead of everybody else early in the game, and I would never make a move like that to help one player start building houses before I would be able to do so as well.

Great, mindless way to decompress after a long day. The update however.... I just downloaded the most recent update to the update and it seems to be a bit better.

I do not notice the same when moving right. The pogo sticks need some reworking. I can rarely see which lane the prize is in at the end of the jump. Finally, some of the challenges have not been working. I had one with no rolls or jumps in a certain number of points that would not increment or ever reach success criteria no matter how long I went. Then suddenly would declare success out of the blue.

And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person.

I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.  These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.","What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.",2,True,general,positive,5

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab. And the playability stuff should never have made it past QA.",This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces.,5,True,general,negative,5

Whenever we introduced something into the house one person always says something negative about it and we end up abandoning it. Yesterday when I purchased this game, I had to entice the whole family to even get together to play this game. When I finally succeed in doing so we tried out the accent card list and we immediately all agreed this was the best game ever!

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time. If you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.",The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win.,2,True,general,positive,5

I‚Äôm not sure if most people agree why we should add emojis but I‚Äôm pretty sure a few of us want emojis. üòâ The second thing is friending each other. Sometimes I make friends but then ( because of my un-lucky life.. ) I always have to go! Then when I tell them, I get so sad because they are my friends! I would really like for you to add friend requesting in the game!! üôÉ  The third thing is when your alive, you can only chat in emergency meetings.

So, I also lose the game and not really angry but kind of annoyed! I feel bad saying this just so you know üôÉ. Those are all my suggestions! Hope a few of them get added!!!!!!

The character select. Sometimes I get in and it‚Äôs fine. A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don‚Äôt show up. Moving on to the next issue. This may be on purpose and if it is it ain‚Äôt hittin right! There is distortion with the little heavenly voices sound when opening something or getting a prize. It gets extremely deep and stuff and doesn‚Äôt sound right. Moving on the the next and last issue. We can‚Äôt get these cakes in five days especially with all this lag.

I started playing from around age 6 and have enjoyed playing this game for 6 years. Even though I feel I‚Äôve only gotten decent recently I think this game is really fun. Not matter your trying to survive the night with your friends in survival, or building the mansion of your dreams in creative, best game ive ever played and has sculpted me as a gamer and in real life from the way I think of architecture and design. I can still remember being scared out my socks when I was only a kindle fire and it was day in the desert, and I went into a cave, then it was pitch black, I started to spin, and then I was lost. No escape. I was in survival for the first time which made it worse. Then Im spinning trying to see a light going deeper and deeper and BOOM! Got blown up by a creeper, let‚Äôs say I stuck to creative for a bit lol üòÇ. I love going on the MC discord and looking at all the amazing feedback I get from other players now that I have some actual good idea of what I‚Äôm doing and I‚Äôm trying to figure out redstone. One thing I would suggest, stop advertising the game as a game for little kids because even though I‚Äôm a kid I know when I‚Äôm an adult if you keep updating I‚Äôll still be playing!

I love this game, I‚Äôm obsessed, I play all the time and I love it!The concept is great! Ten or so people, most are crewmates, who are supposed to fix the ship and keep an eye on things. A couple, however, are imposters and they are supposed to kill all the crewmates while pretending to be one of them. Its a great game. The concept works great! There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn‚Äôt give it, you can‚Äôt get it cause you can‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúProof?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. You also can‚Äôt really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can‚Äôt. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me. Whatever.  I play it enough I would probably pay it.  But don‚Äôt give me the run around and nickel and dime me.  You could spend $100 dollars on this game and NOT UNLOCK EVERYTHING.  are you kidding me?     Change the incentive structure and cost of everything ASAP.  Either offer more coins or lower the prices of the items to get.  I bought the double coins feature.  Still takes a week of playing to buy 1 board.  Then you want to talk about keys?

So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can‚Äôt think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most.

It‚Äôs a lot of fun!There is one thing that I would love to see. When you get a power up like the coin magnet or the bouncy shoes a little flash of light shoots out! Then a little time bar pops up at the bottom showing how long you have said power up. Sometimes you will have multiple power ups and be too focused on the obstacles ahead to really be paying attention to the individual time bars. It would be nice if you could add another little white burst (or some effect) that pops up on the actual character to show the power up has gone away.

Can the world tour travel to Malawi, Africa? My dad grew up there, and I would love to see how you design it. Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point.

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating. Pretty much a scheme to get consumers to spend a lot of money.","Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later.",2,True,security,positive,9

Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes.

I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!,2,True,general,positive,5

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.

It was really fun just trying to get the highest run and the biggest amount of coins. But then, a couple of years after the app came into being, it's levels changed up. It gained new challenges and new characters which did help the game but that classic opening was almost completely gone. I come back a few years later and they are still doing the tour. I mean how long does a tour around the world really take? And now, there are slightly better graphics but it's not the same. There is an ad after almost every run. If you want it to be like majority of the other running games going around right now then this game is definitely for you. It is still fun but the ads have turned me away.

I can‚Äôt ever find the normal nether biome and eventually I give up and create a copy of the world in creative and /locate fortress.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone.

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it!

I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns.

Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome.

Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE.

No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab. And the playability stuff should never have made it past QA.",And the playability stuff should never have made it past QA.,5,True,safety,negative,8

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with. To sum: I‚Äôm really glad Among Us is enjoying its popularity, I just wish they‚Äôd fix it.","If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it.",3,True,general,negative,5

It was a weekly game night activity with my family. However, one day, the app would not even open before it crashed. So, as many people do when troubleshooting, I deleted and again downloaded the app. When downloading, it gave me the ‚Äòfamily download‚Äô message, and being the only option, I of course used it. When I opened the new app, I could not restore purchases because I ‚Äúdo not own the app.‚Äù I have tried everything I could, and having done so, I did what the app said and contacted them about the error. I have emailed probably around six times with no response in about a month. I have purchased 9 decks, some on one account and some from the phone I am trying to get them back on. I understand that they don‚Äôt family share, which is kind of dumb but not the issue. The issue is I spent money on decks to get on my phone. I cannot get them back and the ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù won‚Äôt even respond. I just want my decks back.

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

Or I assume they quit the game because the game will just stop. They won‚Äôt roll, make a trade, or put houses down. The game is at a standstill and I have no idea why. There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future. It‚Äôs super annoying having to leave a game because nobody is moving or being sore losers. I don‚Äôt have any interest in playing this game anymore because of this. It takes so long to even start getting to a place where you‚Äôre making money and getting people to land on your properties so going through all that just to quit because someone doesn‚Äôt want to play the game anymore is annoying.

It would be nice for a friending system! Another suggestion is more customization, there‚Äôs only 12 colors along with a not so massive selection of hats. I‚Äôm not allowed to buy anything online, so it would be cool for more customization for people that can‚Äôt afford to buy more hats and things! My final suggestion is MORE GAMEMODES!!!

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I‚Äôve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

I‚Äôd love to be able to store it for future use when I have 3 hours to waste playing games. Also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying. I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That‚Äôs usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn‚Äôt feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I‚Äôd rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad. In conclusion, this game only remains fun for the first 60 levels then gets frustrating.

All my games just so happen to go the same way.  At first, because the AI is on easy mode, I to great! I‚Äôm usually the first to get monopoly while the AI is rolling decent and realistic rolls. This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI‚Äôs came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

The next thing i'd like to report is that when the imposter leaves in a meeting it won't automatically make the crewmates win, it will wait until the end of the meeting to crash everyone's game. The next thing is sabotaging bugs. The latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged O2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to -11. The next important bug is when you are quick chatting, you might vote someone without knowing. The second to last thing i would like to share is on a mobile device when you first load in it just has part of the o and ng in, probably trying to say among us but it only says ong. Finally, the game is great and all, but i think the quick chat feature kind of got the game to become less popular, because you can't say what you want to say, or people just spam their quick chat thing so even when you say no one will see it or even believe it! You can't even say hi or talk about the latest game! Heck you can't even say gg!

So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it‚Äôs fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot.

To break it down for you: I‚Äôm at level 122 (which is impossible to beat without a booster because of how it is set up), which is about midway through the 5th decoration level in the game (haven‚Äôt even broached the upstairs level yet).

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched.

I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

And in Austin‚Äôs room, when your done with it and everything looks new, there‚Äôs a dusty old desk that doesn‚Äôt go with the room, and I felt  like I should replace it, but I can‚Äôt. There were a few more parts that didn‚Äôt need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin‚Äôs dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn‚Äôt have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep? Also, if nobody had lived in the house for years, why where the clothes on the statues not dusty? If you make another game from another game then shouldn‚Äôt you mention it?

My ONLY complaint, if you play against the AI don‚Äôt expect to win. I‚Äôve won once because AI don‚Äôt get lucky and this is on EASY AI. You can have an entire side of the board and they will almost always land on a spot that is either safe or really low value. If you own the blue and brown by GO for example, they will often times go to JAIL therefore delaying coming close to those properties. Anytime they land on a CHANCE or COMMUNITY CHEST, they almost always get positive cards. They continuously try to trade you if they need a card so that can be tweaked.

That‚Äôs ridiculous. Why should it take that long to get back in the game when I hardly even left? The connection errors/bugs are ridiculous and make it rare to get a solid game in. That‚Äôs unacceptable, really. What‚Äôs the point in playing a game that‚Äôs likely to crash because of bugs? Also, the lack of any form of communication between players is upsetting. Seriously, no chat box? No ability to use our microphones? You want to charge $4 for a board game and not let us speak to each other? They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing!

If that part of the story doesn‚Äôt fry your bacon, then be prepared for pointless  tasks designed to eat up the stars you earn on activities NOT RELATED to repairing the old mansion and the rooms within.

As for the characters; Austin is the know-it-all son, his father a dim-witted buffoon, and his mother has no personality. His relationship with Katherine is uninteresting and ALL other characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. So if any or all of those things appeal to you, download the game.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes.

I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game.

The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out.

So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app. Then I went back in it later and it said I had 93 keys... I was super confused, so I went into the me section where my boards and characters are to see if I still had my Christmas people, but I accidentally bought a character. And I also had the Christmas people too. After being way too confused I got out for the day. Then, this morning i went on to get my daily snowflakes and words and it wouldn‚Äôt let me watch an ad when I died. I had to use keys. Now, I still had 30-something, but if I continued like that, with the amount of time I spend on the game, those keys would be gone super soon. So, if anyone can help me or tell me what happened, that would be great, thanks. (Btw I would rate this a five star but I also want to get attention of the creator or help desk or whatever so I rated my review a one star. Just so you know.)","So I was saving up for all five of the Christmas people, and I finally got 100 keys, so I got it and then left the app.",1,True,general,negative,5

The puzzles and all were really fun. But I just don‚Äôt like the fact that every little thing you do cost multiple stars and so you have to complete multiple levels to do the simplest things that honestly shouldn‚Äôt cost a star at all. Really thought the game would be more focused on designing the house. Not the garden or paying attention to what‚Äôs going on in town. Additionally, I understand the game is supposed to be challenging. But who honestly has time to spend weeks trying beat a single level to continue on with the game. Some levels are literally so difficult that the user ends up frustrated and just closing the game out for the day. Sure I‚Äôve spent a fair amount on money trying to beat those select levels. And I see some user reviews that talk about spending a huge amount of money. But who honestly has time to devote that much energy into a game as well as waste money trying to get through a level just to get stuck and have to spend more money again later on a higher level. Really think the developers should have an option to just skip one if they can see you have tried 100 times and still can‚Äôt get past. It just ruins the game if you can never progress any further.",The puzzles and all were really fun.,3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them.

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet.

I thought I was making the mistakes but nope every game it happens SEVERAL times. Roll a five & it will go 6 to land you on someone‚Äôs hotel...incredibly frustrating.  The game is also very predictable. If you build properties the next roll the next player almost every time won't land on you. I like the game, however another issue is that it freezes up at crucial junctures of the game. Such as after a trade. You have no choice after several minutes to abandon the game. Very frustrating after vesting so much time into it. Also I just finished a game & I bankrupted every player then it announced the last bankrupted player as the ‚Äúwinner!‚Äù.

I used over 80 hoverboards, 1 key and amassed over 4000 coins and a wrecking 3 million score. This was done over a accumulated time of two hours. It was awesome. But I had to go to sleep. I left the app open with my phone charging and went to bed. The next morning, I went straight to my phone, unlocked it, and since it was left on Subway Surfers, it went to Subway Surfers.  Here is where I know most people would be incredibly angry; this is a 3-million-2-hour-score, you know? Instead of going to the ""paused"" part, the app RESTARTED!!! I could've thrown my phone, thrown chairs or whatever, but here I am writing a review. I haven't played the app since, and here's additional information: So I also have the game 2048.

I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That‚Äôs usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn‚Äôt feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I‚Äôd rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones.

And my opponents won‚Äôt land on any of my streets with houses or hotels, but I sure will land on theirs. It‚Äôs very hard to win against the computer, even when opponents are set to easy. Not that I want an easy win. But it would be nice to not always lose every single game. The first game I played, I‚Äôd set my opponents to medium.

So, guess what? You guessed it! When you have already spent gratuitous amounts of money to win something, that never in a million years makes you feel like you won anything, you have to spend more.

Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

You‚Äôll draw Community Chest cards to pay $50 only for the debt to not be taken from your account. You‚Äôll roll the dice only for them to disappear and your turn to never end, the token never moving and it being impossible to reroll the dice.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them.

I‚Äôve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you‚Äôre remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn‚Äôt enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you‚Äôre getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it.

Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high.

I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not.

Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

This game has too many bugs and too few features. Online Multiplayer never works, they‚Äôve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game. The animation is also way too long and it‚Äôs been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers‚Äô minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I‚Äôve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash. And the monopoly Hasbro has over this game makes this distillation of laziness and greed the only game of its kind on App Store, leaving you no choices but to buy it if you want to play this 100-year-old board game.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It‚Äôs the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

Everyone has to have the same version, and the only simple way to join someone's local server is if you are connected to the same WiFi.

The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play. My only quibble is the programming of the computer players. As far as I can tell, the only differences between the easy and hard modes are the likelihood that the computer players will elect not to buy a property or make a bizarre trade. I find that the game is artificially difficult at times because the computer players frequently make unreasonable trades that savvy human players would never make. For example, Dog will make a trade with Penguin that gives Penguin an orange monopoly (at a time when Penguin has tons of money and can immediately build it up to four houses per property). In exchange, Dog got a second red property that Dog can‚Äôt do anything with (because I have the third red property). So Dog gives Penguin an almost insurmountable advantage early in the game for no obvious strategic reason. It seems like a minor gripe in the grand scheme of things, but similar scenarios happen fairly often, which makes the game less fun at times.","The animation is lovely, the load times are quick, and, of course, Monopoly is just fun to play.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

I love how you get to visit new locations (BTW I‚Äôve been to Amsterdam so it was fun to see it in the game.), get cool characters, and enjoy running in the subway.I personally think that the graphics are great. They don‚Äôt have to be perfect, as you can still play the game without problems. I have tried programming before and it IS NOT EASY. I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don‚Äôt need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device. I remember him being very expensive and I would love a way to sign into that account on another device so I could get Tagbot back.Thank you for reading this review.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

I first saw it played on Twitch and said I have got to experience this. The graphics, animation and modeling are really fun. Based on old reviews, I think many issues from the past are solved. The network seems reliable and the rules and variations are pretty much on point. The AI players add a new dimension. They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times. But they‚Äôre fun to push around and like I said, they create a whole new dimension in game play. Imagine making a deal with a predictable robot to mess up your human opponent, etc. That said, the overall game feels cold and lonely. How do we know we are really playing against a human when we join Multiplayer online? What is our own record of wins and losses? What if we want to play against a particular player again?

The next thing i'd like to report is that when the imposter leaves in a meeting it won't automatically make the crewmates win, it will wait until the end of the meeting to crash everyone's game. The next thing is sabotaging bugs. The latest game i played it the imposter sabotaged O2 but then when it got to zero the numbers went onto negatives all the way to -11. The next important bug is when you are quick chatting, you might vote someone without knowing. The second to last thing i would like to share is on a mobile device when you first load in it just has part of the o and ng in, probably trying to say among us but it only says ong. Finally, the game is great and all, but i think the quick chat feature kind of got the game to become less popular, because you can't say what you want to say, or people just spam their quick chat thing so even when you say no one will see it or even believe it! You can't even say hi or talk about the latest game! Heck you can't even say gg! Are we even going to talk about when you try to join the game it says ""the game is full"" when it only showed 2 people in it! Also a lot of the time when you quick chat the letters are not in the chat box you made it's just somewhere out of it!

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

And if you‚Äôre under 13 or whatever age it is, it won‚Äôt even let you chose your own name! What‚Äôs up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I‚Äôm crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn‚Äôt let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat.

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn‚Äôt work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone. The graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well. Also, whose idea was it to change cap of the multiplier from 30 to 29.

Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator).

The videos for coins rarely shows up now, too. When you get and use  power ups that can blow the whole screen, you can see how pieces only react to one object when they should have reacted and been removed due to multiples going off close enough to them. If you have single power ups, they explode pieces that do nothing to help complete the level.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because ‚ÄúRed sus‚Äù I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

This is one of the most frustrating things I‚Äôve ever encountered on a cell phone game because I‚Äôm an avid monopoly player and I‚Äôm well aware that the dice doesn‚Äôt favor anybody at anytime. The math or algorithm behind the dice roll needs to be addressed before I can enjoy this game. COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY unless you have people around you and can play locally.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that‚Äôs not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report. And for those who have never had the game, I really suggest this to anyone of any gender or age.

It is so easy to use, and the 4 dollars that I paid for it was so worth it! This beats any other Monopoly app that I have used BY FAR. It lets you get all the same Monopoly experiences as the board game, such as auctions, but the game is way faster! Also, there are absolutely NO ads! It lets you customize the game rules, too! For example, you can change the number of houses you need to have on a property before you can buy a hotel. My favorite thing about this game is the hassle-free games! Just tap a few buttons, and BOOM! You‚Äôre playing Monopoly! There‚Äôs no organizing money, or dealing with cards, It‚Äôs just SO EASY!!!! I mean, if I could, I would give this game 10 STARS!!!!!! Another great thing about this game is that it saves your games! For example, if you start a game but then you run out of time, you can exit the game and when you open it back up your game is still there.

A lot of the time I get in and none of the characters show up only the shadow and the buttons to buy or select the character also don‚Äôt show up. Moving on to the next issue. This may be on purpose and if it is it ain‚Äôt hittin right! There is distortion with the little heavenly voices sound when opening something or getting a prize. It gets extremely deep and stuff and doesn‚Äôt sound right. Moving on the the next and last issue. We can‚Äôt get these cakes in five days especially with all this lag.

I can fairly say that it is a well-executed game with consistent updates and support. I like the creative side as well as the puzzle side it‚Äôs a nice balance. One thing everyone should know unequivocally before beginning, however, is that the developers hate the players. Hate may not even be a strong enough word for it. I could be wrong, maybe it‚Äôs impossible to fairly balance a puzzle game but to program it so much in the favor of you losing is... unsurprising considering how often it wants you to purchase things. Now, you don‚Äôt have ads in this game, which is nice, and the options to purchase don‚Äôt ensure victory (I mean at all), so in a sense the game is consistent and there‚Äôs some comfort in that. The reward system is pretty rough, it does sometimes feel like an endless attempt to wear you down. You will rage quit from time to time, or put it down for a couple months, but this is a casual game. Whereas other games make me feel as if they‚Äôve earned my business, I find the challenge of this one is seeing how far I can go without spending any money, because it tries so hard. It‚Äôs my tiny moral victory. But hey, great time waster so if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre going for, you‚Äôll likely stay engaged and distracted from your reality and isn‚Äôt that what we all want anyways?",So I‚Äôve played this game for a long time.,3,True,general,positive,5

My game crashes every few minutes, and upon loading the world again it deletes things. There was no need to change the villages' appearances, as they were what made Minecraft, well.. Minecraft. The game doesn't feel the same after the update, and to any new players, I would no longer recommend it. I've played this game for 7 years now, and I've never been this disappointed. A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together. I miss Minecraft being Minecraft and this update's ruined everything. I don't want anyone else to be as disappointed as I am. With the amount of kids that play this game, they don't deserve it.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone.",2,True,effectiveness,negative,2

Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win!

It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don‚Äôt curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters!

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous. The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.","Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves.",3,True,learnability,positive,6

There are so many strategies to use and its so open ended even with rules in place.But however, the new update may have just ruined things for me. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the quick chat was a good idea, but it doesn‚Äôt work as well as you would think. First off, its missing some crucial phrases and questions. Its like impossible to now ask for proof or evidence. If someone doesn‚Äôt give it, you can‚Äôt get it cause you can‚Äôt ask ‚ÄúProof?‚Äù or ‚ÄúWhy?‚Äù. You also can‚Äôt really question people as easily. This makes it very limiting. That wouldn‚Äôt be as much of a problem if you could use the free chat too, but now you can‚Äôt. As of the update, you cannot use the free chat if you are under 18. This basically ruins the game for all kids. The free chat is good, but not by itself.

Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this.

It was very frustrating and I find it completely unfair that they would make you chose where to keep your progress. Especially since this has NEVER happened. The app also gave terrible explanations on what it would do given each option. This was extremely disheartening since I had spent a while doing the wordy weekend hunt and the token run.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places.

Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!

I don‚Äôt know why people are so pressed, i like when the new updates come out because i can see a different map/scenery of the game while playing. Like seeing different colored trains, different buildings, etc. Because I don‚Äôt like seeing the same thing forever, you know? Getting straight back to my point, the update is fine. I saw this one review saying it looked like a kid drew it out. I was reading and comparing to the actual update and I did NOT agree! It‚Äôs a nice update and I like seeing different places in subway surfers! Thanks subway surfers for allowing us to get a different place every update! It means you care and you don‚Äôt want you viewers to get too bored with the same game style every day!

The exception being on occasions were I‚Äôm really bored and have nothing else to do. But this game which I was getting worried for a bit was going down the same path has actually seamed to have a better balance on which task should cost 1,2, or 3 stars and even has some that cost multiple (2 sets of 2) sets. I enjoy this game and will continue to play. I‚Äôm not a fan of adds but if the creators wanted to add a short add to the end of each round as a money source of revenue that wouldn‚Äôt be terrible to help keep the game funded for those that refuse to pay for add ones inside the game.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!","Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.",5,True,general,positive,5

But recently it‚Äôs been laggy, glitchy and it even crashes when I try to play. Normally the game isn‚Äôt that slow but when ever I‚Äôm not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.","I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash!",4,True,enjoyability,negative,4

So why is nothing done to change things (example; coin and star ratios for each level)  I would pay for the game if it meant a more level playing field.  News flash folks... like everything else on the internet the developers are out to fill their coffers and nothing more.  That‚Äôs why this and every other game like it has such a low win ratio (stars & coins).  They are out for your real life dollars, and don‚Äôt give a rats tail about what you think or comments you make.  That‚Äôs how our society and economy work.  You want to progress quicker... pay up.  The only way you can change it is to not spend the money.  Money or lack there of is what gets their attention nothing else.  They will never read this or any other comment.  Or if hell freezes over and they do, they sure don‚Äôt care about what we think of their business practices and never will as long as someone out there is spending real money to advance in the game.

It‚Äôs fun but it totally clickbait me on Instagram with the little games that I haven‚Äôt seen once after downloading. I‚Äôve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you‚Äôre remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn‚Äôt enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you‚Äôre getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it. I shouldn‚Äôt have to waste it because I had work or class. Sometimes you can‚Äôt play for 2 hours at that very second.

I‚Äôd love to be able to store it for future use when I have 3 hours to waste playing games. Also the 900 coins for 5 moves is a little annoying. I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That‚Äôs usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day. Doesn‚Äôt feel value added. And sometimes the tasks are super easy like call someone and it takes 2 games to do it. I‚Äôd rather that be one and replace flooring be 5-6.

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can‚Äôt really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

For example: I start up free play and see an option saying ‚Äúwould you like to turn on intelligent mode?‚Äù I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won‚Äôt let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it‚Äôs fixed though. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fine though, because if you don‚Äôt notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it‚Äôs hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can‚Äôt avoid it. There are a few others that aren‚Äôt as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on.

One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch.

I love this game! The idea is classic, like mafia but in space. It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

I played it with my friend almost every day. But then the update happened. And it changed a lot. Before the update I couldn‚Äôt wait for the new map to come out. It wouldn‚Äôt come out so I deleted the app and reinstalled it. The reinstalled version had the update. First of all, it asks you to type in your birthday. And if you‚Äôre under 13 or whatever age it is, it won‚Äôt even let you chose your own name! What‚Äôs up with that? However it did have the new map. But with the new update I can only use the quick chat thingy which stinks. Anyway, I tried joining a game and when the game was about to tell if I‚Äôm crewmate or imposter or whatever the screen goes black and nothing happens. So I close out of the app and delete the app. When I re-downloaded it it didn‚Äôt let me chose my age again, so I was stuck with the non-custom name and the quick chat. Anyway I joined a game and my screen turned black when the game started again! So I deleted the app, reset my phone, and reinstalled it and the same things happened again! So, now I guess I can‚Äôt play among us anymore.

Also when you get into the game more, it takes so much longer to finish a day, it‚Äôll be like 6% closer to rewards when you win a level. Also I don‚Äôt like how we only have five lives. I feel like we should have more lives than only 5! The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

I love all of the updates and in my opinion the new update every one is complaining about is actually really good! But besides all of the amazing stuff my game has been glitching hardcore. So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can‚Äôt think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine. But stick with private games, and if InnerSloth can, fix these hackers!!!!","However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately.",3,True,general,negative,5

Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.","If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!",3,True,general,positive,5

But recently it‚Äôs been laggy, glitchy and it even crashes when I try to play. Normally the game isn‚Äôt that slow but when ever I‚Äôm not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.","Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I‚Äôve been playing since I was like 5, and the game has never failed to produce quality entertainment. But this, it was just sad to say the least.

The graphics now seem like a downgrade compared to what it used to be, how do you even do that? Seriously, the game used to be good enough to be played by all ages, but now it seems like only 6 year olds can enjoy the design. Another thing, this may have been a glitch or something, but where did my coins go? I had like 700,000+ coins, but after the update I was down to about 100,000. Not cool. Not cool at all.

I might have to delete it to spare my own piggy bank. ***I finally had to delete it*** I refuse to throw away any more money on something so frivolous but kept getting stuck on these ridiculously hard levels with no helps and not enough gold to buy any more. :( they really need to lower the cost of things and give you more gold when you win a level.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I‚Äôm excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future!

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn‚Äôt require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you‚Äôre placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you‚Äôre ranked in the lower levels I‚Äôm convinced this game randomly ‚Äúloosens up‚Äù and you‚Äôre able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I‚Äôm convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game ‚Äútightens up‚Äù and it‚Äôs impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!

It is very entertaining any enjoyable to collect new characters, hover boards, daily challenge items, etc. I can‚Äôt stop playing it! Although it is very neat and fun to play, there are some things that I think should be taken note of. First of all, when I‚Äôm on the main screen on the game, I‚Äôm about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins. Later on I looked on the app and a new character was in, and was 100,000.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts.",2,True,aesthetics,positive,0

If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

Additionally, I understand the game is supposed to be challenging. But who honestly has time to spend weeks trying beat a single level to continue on with the game. Some levels are literally so difficult that the user ends up frustrated and just closing the game out for the day. Sure I‚Äôve spent a fair amount on money trying to beat those select levels. And I see some user reviews that talk about spending a huge amount of money. But who honestly has time to devote that much energy into a game as well as waste money trying to get through a level just to get stuck and have to spend more money again later on a higher level.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

I think we should have an improvement or 2 (I‚Äôm not sure if it is 2, but it‚Äôs still worth the game) for this. It has an excellent interference facing the game but there can be simply a better idea for the game. Also, it has a awesome story. It tells about a person about a house that has to be renovated. This takes talent. The only way is that we did our skills. And the puzzles facing our ways. That‚Äôs the concert. To be honest, it also has days. This never happened in most games in my life. The only reason why because we have to fix the house. I don‚Äôt know why else. But it can also be dived into sections of the game. This is what a like so much. This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups. One more thing before closing the review. 900 coins is a lot for 5 moves. I think you need 1/3 of the amount (300 coins) and save 900 coins for 5 more moves and another thing.

Quick chat just makes the game even more confusing it limits what you get to say. I know the editors of this game probably thought it was a smart idea because people were being mean and saying swearwords to each other but it‚Äôs a really bad idea because, it is more confusing than when I first got this game. I would love it if they removed the quick chat. And plus people are entering the game with their name as ‚Äúme‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù to beat the System. So you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there‚Äôs a new player in the game that doesn‚Äôt even know how to chat. When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn‚Äôt want to see swearwords or if they wanted to. How about you add an account feature where you can make an account to have friends maybe a while-playing chat feature. Please take some of these ideas into consideration because the game is so big.

Jeb‚Äôs wife (I think it‚Äôs Jeb‚Äôs..) liked polar bears, so that‚Äôs why they were added. The original Mobil lite version, and I remember when Minecraft PE was free.

But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right? Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad. And the game goes on without me and the server gets full. Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to others.Update: I‚Äôve now discovered that the ‚ÄúAutomatic role‚Äù system is very bad for me. I‚Äôve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it‚Äôs rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it‚Äôs a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they‚Äôre standing near the body.",Sometimes I get an 30 second long unskippable ad.,5,True,aesthetics,negative,0

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn‚Äôt work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone. The graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well. Also, whose idea was it to change cap of the multiplier from 30 to 29. It makes no sense to change a longstanding norm.","Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect.",1,True,reliability,negative,7

I LOVE this game, considering how hard it is to find a murder mystery game that is fun, challenging, and overall a enjoyable game. And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe. Considering how easy it is to pick up and go, you can really play it whenever you want, which is awesome in on itself, but it only makes it even better is how it‚Äôs free on mobile, is so nice, and it‚Äôs one of the main reasons it got popular in the first place, almost anyone with a phone could get the game! Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS. This makes the game run at a good pace, makes replay ability amazing, and overall a amazing game. So innersloth, I‚Äôm excited for the updates and ideas you have for this game in the future! Amazing work!","And I gotta say, this game nails the classic murder mystery game vibe.",5,True,efficiency,positive,3

To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

But.....,"So this is a great game! and if your not playing it, what are you doing go ahead and download! But anyway this game is super good I have a lot of fun playing it and had a really good first impression but people do get quite annoying and toxic. For example some people who are on your team as imposter will see you kill someone and then report the body and say (your name/ color) DID IT! And it‚Äôs really annoying. Another thing is sometimes bodies that are next to a door that‚Äôs closed, you can‚Äôt see the body not that big of a deal but I‚Äôve gotten voted of bc of it one time, idk if this was a glitch but I think the guy was modding or something but I was in admin on the skeld and the report button popped up but there wasn‚Äôt a body another guy was in there as well and even said there wasn‚Äôt a body on his screen either idk if it was a bug or a modder but I got voted off for it and it frustrated me quite a bit other bugs as well but there not really a big deal because there only there for a min or 2 and the game still operates as it should... plus teaming is a big issue but there‚Äôs not really anything you can do about that.other than these things amazing game definitely recommend.

This is something I heard on the internet and isn‚Äôt original, but I wanted to spread it around because it sounds interesting. What if there was a role called ‚ÄúJester‚Äù where their goal is to get ejected, making them win? Sounds like it could be a hit or miss, but I think that‚Äôd be cool. Also a role of ‚ÄúDetective‚Äù sounds interesting. Like, you can give that person the option to take screenshots, so they can have solid alibis/evidence of the imposter, but only they have it, so that the crew mates don‚Äôt have too much of an advantage. They can send the screenshots to the chat, helping out their case (maybe also a limited amount of screenshots so their not overpowered?). Also the idea of adding friends would be cool! It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once. It would also be nice to adopt mini crew mates whenever their parent dies, I just think that would be very wholesome. More colors would also be cool, I mean, this is only optional since the colors that are already there are great, but I think it‚Äôs something to keep in mind. But overall, fantastic game!

But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing!

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous.

The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode.

However, I bought this app so that I could play with my long distant friends, but we could never finish ANY game. The game has way too many bugs. It crashes and stop the game every time someone disconnect, which affects you and everyone else playing the same match. Getting disconnected is way too common, it happens when you get notification, when you click off the game for a split second, when you get a call, when you get a low battery warning, or poor wifi connection. The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game.

So it said I could buy it for $5.99 and I did, I played on it with my sisters for hours. I really liked it.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is. And even if you are the impostor it still ruins the game because you can execute it perfectly and still get voted out because ‚ÄúRed sus‚Äù I have stopped playing the game because it just never added anything new and became very bland.

This new version is nowhere near as fun to play. Sure, it looks better, and there are more ways for you guys to make more $$ from it, but the new AI algorithm is simply a drag to play. With the old game, if I played 20 games, I could strategize and win about half of them. With this new version, I‚Äôve won only once in 20 games! And that‚Äôs only because I refused to trade. The AI consistently ends up with more funds from giveaways and pays less taxes while the human pays more taxes and gets fewer random giveaways. Please rework the AI algorithm to make it a more enjoyable and better balanced game!!Reply to developer: I never accused the game of being ‚Äúrigged.‚Äù As any programmer knows, there is no such thing as ‚Äúrandom.‚Äù Programming any software takes human choice. My point was that the programming of the old version of Monopoly was more balanced than the present version, and as such, the present app needs to be reworked to be better balanced and more enjoyable to play.For version 1.3: the background (city) sounds are much too loud now! Can barely hear the sound of the board anymore. It‚Äôs the sound of the dice and playing pieces on the board that bring it alive for me. Please lower the city sounds back to where they were.

If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

This is obviously built on that annoying subscription model for premium services. And it‚Äôs not free in the first place. No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better. This is obviously aimed at milking people for buying new playing boards and player pieces. Pretty gross cash grab. And the playability stuff should never have made it past QA.","Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues.",5,True,enjoyability,negative,4

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it‚Äôs all for sun and games. It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again. A friend request feature would go a long way to helping this issue, plus with more friends you can play with, the more people will want to play.All in all this is the best game in the App Store right now 10/10, 100%, 5 stars, it‚Äôs just great.",This game is quickly becoming one of the most popular games on the market right now and that is for good reason.,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people. We have no way of knowing that right off the bat, this is a large issue.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them.

And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

It‚Äôs misleading to give this impression when in fact you are basically candy crushing it out and spending little time ‚Äúfixing things‚Äù and more time playing so that u can fix things. There‚Äôs a story line yes, but honestly the stories end quicker than u can finish a level. Homescape is still a good game. Matching mansions is good and requires less stars to complete tasks.

I noticed that I would strive to get my pink and dark blue set every game, but nobody would land on them once I added houses and/or hotels. I noticed that they would skate right by and all of a sudden I keep going to jail when no player had been the entire game. After 30+ games, you start to notice trends. Today was kind of the breaking point for me when an AI owned Park Place and nobody owned Boardwalk. This was the beginning of the game and neither I nor the 3 AI‚Äôs had more than 2 or 3 properties and nobody was close to a set. I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each.

No, I don‚Äôt want to pay extra for a new board or player piece...it‚Äôs just software. Give me a break.Second, there are some pretty bad playability issues. One is initiating trades; the user interface makes it impossible to pick multiple things on the left half of the screen because the player boxes cover the properties. Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game. Not only that, but the AI player that initiated the auction will bid all the way up to the original cost of the property...why on earth would anyone ever do that? Sloppy gameplay for sure.The older Monopoly game on the App Store, which I purchased long ago, was quite a bit better.

I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games‚Äîand even that doesn‚Äôt get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated. Then decided to try carpet and furniture rather than fountains and flowers.

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes. Those are a few small but very effective features I think us among us users would love and highly appreciate! Thank you for this amazing game and I hope you take into account these suggestions!",You could even use it for persuasion purposes.,5,True,general,positive,5

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

Normally the game isn‚Äôt that slow but when ever I‚Äôm not on WiFi or have a poor connection , it takes 5 minutes to just to make the type of world that I want! Before the game would be a little slower than normal, but never THAT slow. I could be casually playing and it would glitch so bad, it would crash! And oddly enough when I try to pause the games it would take over 5 minutes for it to load the menu. Besides that, the gameplay is good, and the graphics are outstanding when you have a good internet connection. The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers. The game updates every once in a while and often features a fun new addition. And the in-game shop has a few free skins, worlds and has deals that are often good. However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.","I love Minecraft and have playing since it was on the Xbox 360, and I have loved everything about it!",4,True,general,positive,5

I enjoy playing this with my friends, we all have a good time! Although you don‚Äôt know people you play with in random servers it‚Äôs fun playing with them to. So like I was explaining how the game is a fun experience there is also some issues I have with it. One being the hackers (you probably did something about that already, my bad if you already did) and lots and of glitches. I always get kicked out of the game due to an error or some weird glitch. I also have a problem with some of the people in the game treat it as if it‚Äôs tinder and flirt with people in the game. I know there‚Äôs probably no fixing that but it kinda gets annoying being for them to be like that. Also, I think you should make like a friend thing where like you can befriend people in the game and they can send you ( or you send them) friend request and when either of you accept then you can chat with them and join the same game as them so you don‚Äôt have to go through like hundreds of other servers to see them again.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.",Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally.,3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Third and on the bad side, i wish there is a way for an actual chat rather than the pre wording that is not even applicable for every scenario. EG, if trading cards, reasoning for trades or refuse etc. that would be like the actual game and that will add the excitement in playing. Also, themes, boards, and tokens are way expensive. Would be nice since the game itself is paid, features should be lesser the price and not higher than the actual game. Lastly, on that note i wish there is an option to add the player as a friend for future game.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else.

Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way. Make farms for food, enchant your weapons, and explore villages. There is so much more to do! I‚Äôve played this since I was 4 years old and I still do! It‚Äôs AWESOME! If people hate on Minecraft, then I‚Äôm very disappointed in them. Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year‚Äôs Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I‚Äôm always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can‚Äôt wait for the new nether update coming! It‚Äôs advanced the nether A LOT! It‚Äôs just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it‚Äôs VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it!

I LOVE IT!!!,"I‚Äôve been playing Subway Surfers since I was a little kid and practically grew up with it. Even now I think it‚Äôs such a fun and exciting game. It definitely can help pass time. Two really cool characters I would LOVE to have you guys bring back is Mimi and Rabbot. I missed both of them and couldn‚Äôt get a chance to have them as characters. Speaking of Mimi, if I‚Äôm correct she does have a pet otter which is super cute. I don‚Äôt know if the otter runs with her when she is trying to evade the inspector, but if it does I think that the Subway Surfers team should have a pet isle where players can choose an animal to run with them like the inspector has a dog. I would absolutely DIE if that could happen. I also definitely think that younger players would enjoy this. Please consider because I think it will definitely draw more attention to this amazing game. Besides that I think this game has amazing graphics and deserves to have ‚Äúhype‚Äù I also like how you guys make different maps that represent different parts of the world.

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn‚Äôt get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

First of all, when I‚Äôm on the main screen on the game, I‚Äôm about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins.

The most recent major annoyance is the red exclamation point on the Shop button. After I click the daily reward and the offers, the red exclamation point still remains. What the heck?!? I don‚Äôt want to keep seeing it. Yes, I know there are special offers, and the daily reward is ready, but what else? The third annoyance is ads within ads. What is this new type of purgatory? I see a screen playing a different ad within the ad that‚Äôs playing. And the last annoyance (for now, anyway) is that the sound is not always off even when the phone is on silent. What if I were in an important board meeting and surreptitiously playing Subway Surfers and the sound for the ad bursts out? If I silence the game, I expect the ads to be silenced as well.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

I hate how bulky they are and how they make me feel like I‚Äôm moving slow. I also can‚Äôt stand the magnetic ability in them.

I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes.

But when you have 10 more moves left and you win the level you are lucky to win 58 coins?!?!  And you just better break out your dollars because some levels you will be killing yourselves to win. Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me.

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please. I also just deleted the app. I have no patience for things like this.

So why is nothing done to change things (example; coin and star ratios for each level)  I would pay for the game if it meant a more level playing field.  News flash folks... like everything else on the internet the developers are out to fill their coffers and nothing more.  That‚Äôs why this and every other game like it has such a low win ratio (stars & coins).  They are out for your real life dollars, and don‚Äôt give a rats tail about what you think or comments you make.  That‚Äôs how our society and economy work.  You want to progress quicker... pay up.  The only way you can change it is to not spend the money.  Money or lack there of is what gets their attention nothing else.  They will never read this or any other comment.  Or if hell freezes over and they do, they sure don‚Äôt care about what we think of their business practices and never will as long as someone out there is spending real money to advance in the game.

It‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and creative. But the LAG. Recently, a few days ago, when playing with my friend in a world, it kept kicking me out of the app, disconnecting me, yet I have full bars of internet. One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.). I hate that every time I see a horse, I have to change cheats on and change to creative to get a saddle.I would also like if we could make realistic things like tables, plates to put in our food in, chairs, etc. Although minor, it would still be a great update if it was actual c: Edit: I just dropped it down to 1 star, maybe even deserves zero for how much I disconnect and lag. It‚Äôs frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi. It‚Äôs really annoying and I recommend to find out what‚Äôs going on, because my internet is 3 bars and my device is new.","However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app.",1,True,reliability,negative,7

However, I am confident that the game will continue to be hashed out in the coming months and eventually will fix the bugs and add more features.The amount of games that are completed before some kind of bug freezes up the game is very slim. This is unfortunate for a game that requires a decent time investment to complete. I also find myself wondering what happens when a player decides to quit. Is that why the game freezes? Are they replaced with an AI? If so, why doesn‚Äôt it tell me that I‚Äôm playing AI? Is the game freezing from and idle player? If so, can there be a boot timer? Are people rewarded for finishing games? Are people penalized for not finishing games?

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning.

It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them.

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game. Regardless of some minor issues, this game is absolutely phenomenal and highly suggest downloading it! My advice to you is to first read the ‚Äúhow to‚Äù, it will tremendously help you get a head start on the game. Once you download this game, you won‚Äôt be able to stop playing!

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.","I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun. The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins! It‚Äôs not fair, and you are forcing people to spend money if they want to continue in the game at a reasonable pace. Love the game, hate the setup!

I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game.

I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.           I hope your reading my review Mojang because these could help Minecraft and have more people play the game.

It was a weekly game night activity with my family. However, one day, the app would not even open before it crashed. So, as many people do when troubleshooting, I deleted and again downloaded the app. When downloading, it gave me the ‚Äòfamily download‚Äô message, and being the only option, I of course used it. When I opened the new app, I could not restore purchases because I ‚Äúdo not own the app.‚Äù I have tried everything I could, and having done so, I did what the app said and contacted them about the error. I have emailed probably around six times with no response in about a month. I have purchased 9 decks, some on one account and some from the phone I am trying to get them back on. I understand that they don‚Äôt family share, which is kind of dumb but not the issue. The issue is I spent money on decks to get on my phone. I cannot get them back and the ‚Äúcustomer service‚Äù won‚Äôt even respond. I just want my decks back.

Minecraft is a one of a kind game with so much potential that it has already given us. More cool ideas can always be added. It has an awesome community, lots of servers and cool mods, and even has cool stuff like Minecon for you to look forward to. Because of COVID19, this year‚Äôs Minecon might be cancelled. I really hope not. Anyways, that is off topic to this review. I have so many good experiences playing Minecraft. I can remember worlds that me and my cousins would play in. We would build hotels and make our own parkour courses. We tested out with redefine and command blocks, too. Seriously, games like Fortnite have NOTHING against Minecraft! I‚Äôm always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can‚Äôt wait for the new nether update coming! It‚Äôs advanced the nether A LOT! It‚Äôs just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year.

Or they still follow you and explode in creative mode in the MCPE I enjoyed. Keyword: enjoyed. This is supposed to be portable? Hence ""Pocket Edition"" but now if I play it without wi-if it crashes. I played when hunger bars didn't exist. When it would be that if you move in water you swim up, when mobs could attack you from underwater or well let's say I was really deep into the ocean. The zombie just attacks me if I am under it. When you couldn't well screw it I just played for a long time let's say that. A suggestion? The launcher like choosing a mcpe version you like.  Just like java. Also please add the option to remove features and mobs without turning cheats on. Let's say I removed drowned. Cheats don't turn off. If I remove all hostile mobs. Never.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.",Another problem is the keys.,4,True,safety,negative,8

I‚Äôve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

When we would ask what did you do for the weekend Amoung us would be a popular game they all played. After a while, I found myself wanting to play the game more and more. I downloaded the app and found myself loving it! The game was relatively easy to play, and fun. While, I enjoyed the game their were still some downsides. One of the major cons was the gaming community in the app. People can have offensive name, and bully people without getting kicked out of the game. Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge. It is challenging in its own way though, like collaboration with people. It can be hard to reason with people. For the reasons above , I quite the game. I still, want to give a shout out to the game developers for providing some fun, and hope they pay attention to my complaints.

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

It‚Äôs sad you can‚Äôt add anyone, and the strangers you could enjoy playing with you‚Äôll only play with once.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).  I realize they do want you to spend money and i have but even when you spend, it doesn‚Äôt give you much in return.  I mostly just wanted to let people know you don‚Äôt have to spend money to win this game...and yes, some of the tasks are eye rolling but....its still a fun game.  Even if you don‚Äôt feel like playing, you can still receive a daily reward for logging on.",To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.,5,True,enjoyability,negative,4

Like in the beginning when I was trying to repair the entry hall, the can of paint spilled. I know that it only took 1 star to clean it up, but really? That part was a waste of coding and time for one little thing that they don‚Äôt need, and it was annoying. I just started playing, and I already like it, but I also see that it will be a little stubborn and slow at certain times. And in Austin‚Äôs room, when your done with it and everything looks new, there‚Äôs a dusty old desk that doesn‚Äôt go with the room, and I felt  like I should replace it, but I can‚Äôt. There were a few more parts that didn‚Äôt need to be there, but they put them there. Like when Austin‚Äôs dad stomps on the floor and breaks it, he they didn‚Äôt have to do that. Austin would have repaired it anyway. I am also confused about when Austin got to the house and went into his room and instead of a bed, there was a couch. Where did he sleep? Also, if nobody had lived in the house for years, why where the clothes on the statues not dusty? If you make another game from another game then shouldn‚Äôt you mention it?

In the actual game you have to play a matching game and place furniture down.      The good thing about this game is that it is super fun and not to hard to play.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages. Something no game will ever get out of me. As soon as games start to cheat you into wanting to spend your real money is when it gets deleted from my phone.

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

It seems once you pass a certain level the puzzles of course become get more difficult but they also seem to give the game an unfair advantage over the player. As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective. Where on prior levels you can get a few boosters and they could help you win the level, but later it takes more than triple the amount of boosters to pass the level and they don‚Äôt seem to be as powerful. Some levels are almost not passable without spending actual money to buy enough boosters so you can pass it or unless you just get lucky and pieces fall just right.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high. I also would like to see the game have challenges instead of only being able to run on an endless road.

Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

First of all, when I‚Äôm on the main screen on the game, I‚Äôm about to click the screen to start playing, but the is always and add that pops up and I always click it. This has happened several times and it has been frustrating. Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive. Sometimes the characters can be up to $2.99 in real money or a whole heck of a lot in game money. I never really get anything on subway surfers but one time I had saved all my money for Tasha, one of the characters. She was about 30,000 coins. Later on I looked on the app and a new character was in, and was 100,000. Although there are some bugs in the game, it is very fun and I defiantly recommend getting it.","Another thing is that when new characters are invited into the game, they are always super expensive.",4,True,cost,negative,1

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else‚Äôs review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together.

This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out.

Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE.

That type of gameplay is so small & almost insignificant that it‚Äôs pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising. If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars.

However, when there isn‚Äôt a deal or a promotion for the shop the items can be quite expensive. The items range from 100 coins (0.99) to over 1,000 coins (around $20). Unless you are willing to put in money, you won‚Äôt have the more fun and interactive worlds/skins. TL;DRGood game overall. Has a fun shop with some free stuff and has fun updates. Has some bad glitches but bearable.","The servers are fun to play, and often has a variety of games on the servers.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and creative. But the LAG. Recently, a few days ago, when playing with my friend in a world, it kept kicking me out of the app, disconnecting me, yet I have full bars of internet. One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.). I hate that every time I see a horse, I have to change cheats on and change to creative to get a saddle.I would also like if we could make realistic things like tables, plates to put in our food in, chairs, etc. Although minor, it would still be a great update if it was actual c: Edit: I just dropped it down to 1 star, maybe even deserves zero for how much I disconnect and lag. It‚Äôs frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi. It‚Äôs really annoying and I recommend to find out what‚Äôs going on, because my internet is 3 bars and my device is new.","It‚Äôs fun, entertaining, and creative.",1,True,enjoyability,positive,4

It can be technically called a brain game because the idea of lying and deceiving your ‚Äúteam‚Äù is very cool way to stretch your detective skills. Personally, this game is really fun! I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining! I think it would be nice to friend request and then we can request our friends to be able to join the public server we are in! It would save a ton of time.

Second of all, there has been numerous amount of glitches in the past few days. To start off, it will randomly kick you out of a game while you‚Äôre  in the middle of one. This really makes me mad and frustrated because of how many times it‚Äôs happened. Next, there is a hacker. You will join a game and the screen will be all black and you can free run wherever. Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed. Thankfully, they have said that instead of making an ‚ÄúAmomg us #2‚Äù they will wait of and be trying to fix these bugs instead. I would wait until around November, as they said that‚Äôs when it should be fixed. I also say you should be 12+ to have this game.

I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline.

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

Many of the hosts do not seem bothered by this,  and don‚Äôt even think to ban or kick these people from the game.  As time went by I found the game less entertaining and it became boring. Even with the different maps, which I have tried; all the game is finish task look off suspicion and repeat. I really thought it be more of a challenge.

Plus the world I was trying to get into didn‚Äôt even have Xbox achievements. So fantastic job, just fantastic. Now I have to sign in, sign out every time I get WiFi.

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang. Thank you for changing my life.","As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side.",5,True,general,positive,5

The kite will do what it‚Äôs supposed to and the bombs won‚Äôt go and destroy the next move. The rocket with a kite won‚Äôt go and clear the row with already a rocket in it, thus ruining 2 rockets. Decorating wasn‚Äôt as hard either. You didn‚Äôt need a star to make every call and 2 stars for a rehearsal. Around level 900 it started getting frustrating and I stopped for a while. A few months ago I started playing and nothing is the same. The power ups are there to ruin your game. One has to depend on luck than tact to win. It‚Äôs now designed to eat all your hammers, kites, gloves etc but still won‚Äôt let you win. If I was frustrated before, I‚Äôm finding it hard to express myself now. Ofcourse the proportion of coins you win to the stars you earn was always unfair but atleast I knew that in every game there would be some move and a definite chance to win. They want you to buy coins, I get it, they are after all here for the money. But looks like they‚Äôre taking away the fun factor away from the game which for me has been the biggest disappointment.

I feel it's challenging, but not frustrating, very satisfying. I like gameplay more than Gardenscapes, which I still play as well. My only complaint is one others have had as well, this game is called HOMEscapes, but for weeks the story line has me upgrading the garden when I've only renovated 3 rooms in the gigantic mansion. Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion! My daughter played this game as well and mostly stopped playing when the garden renovation began because she wanted to renovate the home. I can see how those with less patience would easily give up if they want home renovation instead of the garden. I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with? Otherwise, I love the gameplay. Just stick to the idea of home renovation instead of branching to other story lines for so long.

Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game. And the few moves it gives you to play and the purple blocks that has the bugs in them good luck they get much harder in higher up levels. This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world.

I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

Although, I see a lot of negative feedback, I 100% disagree. To explain the complaints about how hard it is to beat people who are in gold/diamond, they have worked hard to get to where they are. So, yes it may be a little challenging to beat them but that‚Äôs not the games fault. I believe this game is one of the best games out there. Especially because the game is culture friendly. This game has characters from all over the world, and even characters that are make believe or just not real. I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer. I tried these match three types of games several times now and always delete them quickly once the repetition of levels hits. If the match three aspect was a minor part rather than 90% of playing these would be tremendous fun, I‚Äôd even consider paying for that.",Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins.,2,True,cost,negative,1

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play!

Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game.

You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI‚Äôs came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player.

If you decide to just stick with private mode then you will be absolutely fine. You can have a fun time with some friends and overall enjoy this game. But then I tried public games.It wasn‚Äôt as bad as you think it would be. I ran into a total of one weirdo and was totally fine. I had no problems. The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine. But stick with private games, and if InnerSloth can, fix these hackers!!!!","While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

But, I would like to request a feature. Could there be an option to have more intelligent crew mates/impostors in free play? For example: I start up free play and see an option saying ‚Äúwould you like to turn on intelligent mode?‚Äù I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it‚Äôs happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature.

I know this is good for internet safety etc etc but it‚Äôs really annoying. First of all the age limit should not be 18. For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say ‚Äú(A) was running away from the body.‚Äù Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don‚Äôt have options to say it, but when it does happen you can‚Äôt do anything about it. That‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt like this new update and wish that Among Us would go back to the way it was before.","I have loved playing Among Us up until the new update, when they added a quick chat feature instead of letting you type whatever you want.",4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

It is so addicting and I love playing it with my friends. I would 100% recommend this game. I would give it 5 stars, however there are three things I would love to see added. The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S. I heard the developers are working on a game called among us 2 and I think it will include all of these features and I am soooo excited for that!","Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits.",4,True,general,positive,5

The levels are so hard and the payout is so low. I‚Äôm deleted the game today because I don‚Äôt spend ‚Äúreal‚Äù money on games, especially when there isn‚Äôt a good return. The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels. Also, when you win 2or 3 hours of free play, it should be put away so I can play when I want to. If I win 3lives on the wheel, it gets put away...I should be able to play an hour at a time when I want to play....I worked hard to win those hours and I should be able to play them.

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.","Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues).",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Reason being, how it really makes you wonder about life‚Äôs unexplored lore, and a bunch of possibilities that may come across you in the future. I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn‚Äôt a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it‚Äôs more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you‚Äôre living a dream come true, which I feel like it‚Äôs more than just a game. This is why I‚Äôve been sticking with Minecraft ever since the past decade, and would definitely recommend this game to anyone that is into video games.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.

The concept and game idea itself is why people enjoy playing so much. The game allows you to work to deceive and lie to people in a way that is totally expectable socially because it‚Äôs all for sun and games. It‚Äôs the same game over and over and over again yet you still have people returning to play more which really says something about how great it is. I could play like 20 games in a row and never get bored. A lot of people feel this same way which is probably why the game is so successful and although that‚Äôs good, it comes with a price. That price is more content. People need more and more content and if the demand isn‚Äôt met with even small additions like new tasks or new colors for characters then the game will slowly start to die out. A big thing people want is the ability to have friends. You can play like 40 games with the same person and really bond with them and get to know them, only for both of you to be kicked out of the game for an update or hacking or something and you‚Äôd never be able to see them again.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky. So overall, this game is pretty good, but it could use some improvements.","They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game.",4,True,general,positive,5

Sure, the advertisements can be a bit annoying, but that is really a small hiccup in the game, and besides, a free game has to have some kind of advertisements to keep it alive, so it‚Äôs hardly even a problem. The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task. And the fact that you can have small meetings to decide who they think the murderer/imposter is, is GENIUS.

To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high.

With the Homescapes game I am enjoying a feeling of accomplishment again but I assume that too will soon end. I think the developers have made it way too hard to make any progress that the discouragement way outweighs any fun. Why not give us a way to earn more points (rather than watching commercials about other games‚Äîand even that doesn‚Äôt get you much)? I almost deleted Gardenscapes last week I was so frustrated.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

Sometimes I feel like I am in the game itself. I like how they give you head starters and the font and if you die they sometime let you come back alive after just watching a video. The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button.

Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

I‚Äôve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated!

I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly.

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I‚Äôve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it‚Äôs easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I‚Äôm not complaining that mobile players get updates later I‚Äôm just saying that at the time I‚Äôm typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can‚Äôt update. Now I don‚Äôt know how updates for this game work since I‚Äôve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1.

One last thing, smart AI for Freeplay. I read someone else‚Äôs review and I too would love to have smarter AI as an option. This game is amazing. Edit: so I just had an idea. For the Charles headphone hat, maybe there could be an alternative broken headphones because of the Valiant Hero ending? Edit 2: sorry if a bunch of people are dumping a lot of ideas in you, but I had an idea just now. What if there are different body types for different kill animations? For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn‚Äôt a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it‚Äôs more than just a game. The credits screen feels like you‚Äôre living a dream come true, which I feel like it‚Äôs more than just a game.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

I start with creative and build everything I want (sometimes I get lucky and find a village) and stock up on everything. I mean EVERYTHING.

Ok I didn‚Äôt use EVERYTHING. I didn‚Äôt use endermans because (1) they scare the heck out of me and (2) they could just teleport out of their prison cell and murder me ruthlessly in my sleep.

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.

You can play worlds in survival or creative, with cheats on or off. The 5 default servers are The Hive, Lifeboat, Mineplex, Mineville City, and Cubecraft games. But there are tons of other servers around too. It constantly updates proving it won‚Äôt go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile.

You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there‚Äôs not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that‚Äôs really all that‚Äôs important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game.

It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

I could care less about the sneakers. In fact, I try to avoid them as much as I possibly can and when I do accidentally get them, I sigh and roll my eyes.

Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin.

But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time. If you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.","People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine.",2,True,general,positive,5

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again.

Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet.

The only real issue I had with this game was connection issues, but again, the game overall kinda shadows out the issues. The tasks/mini games are probably one of the best parts about this game, each one feels fun to do, especially if you can get a rhythm for each task.

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for.

Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out. For me, listening to the soundtrack and the scent of Winter Candy Apple by Bath and Body Works brings back all the memories. Minecraft will always be with us.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4?

The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between.

It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful.

I would like to give a shoutout to whoever made this game because it is fabulous, no matter what others say.I do think that the characters are a little over priced, but that is just me. I do like how there are lots of ways to earn the money for them. (Play the game itself, watch adds, get mystery boxes, ETC.)Maybe you could add a feature where you could sign in with another account. I get that you don‚Äôt need an account to play (And that is great!) but my favorite character, Tagbot, is on my other device.

The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake.

Usually, after trying to play for 30 seconds or so, the app will kick me, along with my iPod heating up A LOT. This is the only device I really have to play Minecraft PE on. So, I would really appreciate a fix in the next update that will improve the game efficiency-wise. And, next time there is a big update that will lag older devices, don't allow those devices to be updated. At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now). Honestly, I haven't had my device charged for a few days, and when I did, I turned all the graphics down, etc., and it helped. However, it makes the game very hard to enjoy, pretty much impossible for me. Very disappointed. It still does kick me, and the inventory menu stuff seems laggy and slow still.

Then when you check the chat it has a link telling you random stuff and to vote for trump. This can be really scary for young ones and we should also not bring any thing political into a game that kids are playing for fun. Also, in the text it says it will hack with your WiFi. Which is true, not for me, but people I know. It logs them out of their WiFi and disconnects them where they can or rejoin. I would really recommend to wait to download the app until these bugs have been fixed.

So what I did is actually re download my game and lie my age to be older to get past that problem, and it worked from then, now the new update with the new airship which I like the new map, however I am still navigating everything before I play any online games with it. I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this.

Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.  What would happen if a BIG win came back?  You can afford it.  Lord knows you made enough off of me.  A+ for the games creativity and graphics.

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

I‚Äôve gotten so frustrated so many times I had to stop playing for a couple of days because the levels get so hard you need god to help you and not boosters. Sometimes the normal levels are harder than the hard ones. Not only that but you start by collecting 1 star per game to having to pass multiple levels for one task, which can take 3 stars per task when it used to be 1 Star per task. And I hate when you‚Äôre remodeling a room and at of nowhere something happens in another room you have to fix. Like, everything is supposed to be new, why are they making me waste my stars on a room I had already finished ? And 5 lives isn‚Äôt enough! Either give me more lives or make them take less than 30 minutes each to reload. Oh and lastly if you‚Äôre getting a gift for infinite time let us choose when we can use it.

The amount of coins that are needed to buy things like boosters and lives are crazy high. 900 coins for 5more moves on a level is crazy and then if you want to do it again, it‚Äôs 1200! When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

There is so much glitches present in Among Us. The last round I played the impostor was the only one remaining but the round was continuing. The black screen glitch is extremely common and sometimes the lobby glitches into the map and the game is unplayable. Second reason: The game barely updates. Ever since I started playing the game, the biggest update (not including bug fixes) was the chat assist and that is about the only new thing I can name. For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence. This makes the game very easy for the impostor because of how gullible the majority of the community is.

If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design.

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star",Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù.,1,True,security,negative,9

This positive trend follows into the middle game up until the endgame. During the endgame, their is a switch.  With 2 players bankrupt, me having a thousand dollars minimum 2-4 monopolies all with a few houses and hotels. The other player is generally just as good. But, something changes. For some reason the AI just so happens to just the correct numbers to avoid my hotels/2-4 houses...for like 6 rotations to the board... they literally almost never land on my properties when there is only one AI left.  Me in contrary, is landing on every single one of their and gets all the chance cards which make me pay more. The chance cards they land on gives them money no matter what in the endgame. You cannot tell me this game is rigged against the player. Sometimes AI‚Äôs came back several thousands of dollars and ended up winning.  The game while fun, is against the human player. If not, explain my experiences. ‚ÄúWhich happened consecutively‚Äù","The game while fun, is against the human player.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server?

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.",I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins.,5,True,efficiency,negative,3

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone.",3,True,cost,negative,1

They‚Äôre also charging $30 for a season pass that I believe features strictly cosmetics. üôÑ Marmalade, if you want our money at least give us a solid game. Another complaint I have is the only games rules we have to choose from are: Classic and Quick mode. It would be nice to have the options to change the rules/play custom games and whatnot.

When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice.

It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool.

Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete.

Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have.

For example: I start up free play and see an option saying ‚Äúwould you like to turn on intelligent mode?‚Äù I turn it on and free play starts. It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode.

I noticed that I would strive to get my pink and dark blue set every game, but nobody would land on them once I added houses and/or hotels. I noticed that they would skate right by and all of a sudden I keep going to jail when no player had been the entire game. After 30+ games, you start to notice trends. Today was kind of the breaking point for me when an AI owned Park Place and nobody owned Boardwalk. This was the beginning of the game and neither I nor the 3 AI‚Äôs had more than 2 or 3 properties and nobody was close to a set. I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade. The next turn he rolled, landed on Boardwalk, completed the set, and put several houses on each. I‚Äôm pretty intelligent and am very good at recognizing patterns. Not saying it‚Äôs rigged, but adding this to the difficulty level makes the game incredibly frustrating and not fun to play.",I offered everything I had plus ONE THOUSAND dollars and the AI refused my trade.,3,True,cost,negative,1

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun. The boards get harder, naturally, but you still only get 1 star for the Hard and Super Hard boards when you win them. But tasks take upwards of 6 and even more stars to complete. And some tasks are just ridiculous to even warrant a star! Make a call, move an object, can take 2 stars at times!! It makes it extremely hard and tedious to advance in the game. Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins! It‚Äôs not fair, and you are forcing people to spend money if they want to continue in the game at a reasonable pace. Love the game, hate the setup!

I try to spread positivity in the chat reassuring people that it‚Äôs just a game no need to get mad. But... when I do I just get called racial slurs, homophobic slurs, and horrible names in general. When joining a game on WiFi it will keep saying unable to connect. And it is too hard to kick people from games especially when everyone has to vote for them to leave. Teaming is a HUGE issue in the game with entire groups of friends outing the imposters as soon as the game starts. The emergency button is used too often... or often use it to SAY HI!!! I find it frustrating when trying to play the game. PLEASE ADD A VOICE CHAT OPTION!!!

My high score was like 80,000. Well HIGHER! They completely reset my high score. At first I was confused because I was proud of my high score, and trying to beat it, but then IT GOT RESET!

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it‚Äôs easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I‚Äôm not complaining that mobile players get updates later I‚Äôm just saying that at the time I‚Äôm typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can‚Äôt update. Now I don‚Äôt know how updates for this game work since I‚Äôve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them.

It is a great game to play with friends and just play in your free time. I love being the imposter and being a crewmate is just as fun. Though, so people have been hacking the game and choosing who the imposter is, walking outside the ship, and sabotaging when they are even not a crewmate. (By the way, crewmates cannot sabotage.) It makes the game a little less fun, but it is still great. Though, recently, they updated it so that in the chat, you cannot say things that you want to say and instead you can only say stuff like ‚ÄúBlah is the imposter!‚Äù or ‚ÄúBlah vented!‚Äù (The imposter can go though vents to travel faster.) It is WAY more confusing than the older version and it makes it a little less enjoyable. When I couldn‚Äôt figure out how to operate the chat to say something, people assumed I was the imposter and voted me out. (You can vote people out if people vote them out.) I know that they did this so that it can be safer so that people don‚Äôt say bad words, but it is difficult. Also, I know that the people who made among us cannot change this, but could you at least put ‚ÄúI am having trouble using the chat,‚Äù or something like that?

Listening to these songs, all the memories flow in and rush back, and I think about my brother and cousin building a mansion, and me begging to play, or when my brother would still play with me. This game was my childhood. And while everyone else is crooning over Fortnite, Minecraft remains the best. The music is just magnificent. But, there are a few things that need fixing. Whenever I get on, it says there was an account error, and I don‚Äôt even have an account. Also, I made a few characters and they fail to load. Finally, I just wish on Pocket Edition you could go back to different updates so I could play like I used to; no bees, no dolphins, no crazy stuff - just how the game started out.

Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

It gets annoying when I join only to be wearing their skin. Another thing is that the game constantly kicks me out. I‚Äôll be playing and my screen will freeze a lot. Keep in mind, I‚Äôve tried everything. I‚Äôve deleted tons of apps, cleared data from things, just to make sure that I have space on my device (and it‚Äôs not that).

I‚Äôve tried purging all my apps again to clear even more space and I don‚Äôt know what else to do. It gets to the last couple of bars in the loading screen and freezes.

Including mundane actions like calling someone on the phone or greeting a friend. This wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if the puzzles were at least designed more fairly. It seems once you pass a certain level the puzzles of course become get more difficult but they also seem to give the game an unfair advantage over the player. As the levels become more difficult even the boosters seem less effective. Where on prior levels you can get a few boosters and they could help you win the level, but later it takes more than triple the amount of boosters to pass the level and they don‚Äôt seem to be as powerful. Some levels are almost not passable without spending actual money to buy enough boosters so you can pass it or unless you just get lucky and pieces fall just right. Even when you do complete a puzzle the amount of coins you win doesn‚Äôt seem to match up with the difficulty of that puzzle. Only receiving 60 coins for a puzzle it took 20 times to pass.Making it feel almost not worth all the times you had to play to pass the single puzzle.

I downloaded the latest update, got on it to check out all of the new features they added, but it went into super-lag mode, and won't really allow me to even legitimately play it. Usually, after trying to play for 30 seconds or so, the app will kick me, along with my iPod heating up A LOT. This is the only device I really have to play Minecraft PE on. So, I would really appreciate a fix in the next update that will improve the game efficiency-wise. And, next time there is a big update that will lag older devices, don't allow those devices to be updated. At least put it in the update details that it won't work on device x,y, and z (I did have automatic updates on, in fairness, but I have disabled auto-updates now).

All my peers were chattering about a seemingly endless canvas, a world so filled with animals and landmarks, yet so empty to the creative mind. A world to be filled with whatever you wish, all in your pocket. To this day, I still believe this is the best purchase I have ever made in my lifetime. Any boring, gloomy day was instantly changed upon starting up this masterpiece of an app. Any player regardless of age has the opportunity to escape to a place where your imagination can flow endlessly. A place to escape the sometimes harsh realities of the real world. I am now a teen in highschool, awaiting my days until graduation as well as my days until adult life. I recently started up the app after years of inactivity due to the minuscule amount of time available for leisure nowadays, especially for the average highschool student. I noticed the changes made to the game. And then when sunset arrived, memories came flooding back. The memories of summer nights spent with friends in this little world that taught us so much. A game that taught us to never put a boundary to our imagination. As I reminisced, I realized how much the game has shaped me as a person. As friends, days, months, and years went in and out of my life, this game has always remained by my side. A lifelong friend. Thank you mojang.

Quick chat just makes the game even more confusing it limits what you get to say. I know the editors of this game probably thought it was a smart idea because people were being mean and saying swearwords to each other but it‚Äôs a really bad idea because, it is more confusing than when I first got this game. I would love it if they removed the quick chat. And plus people are entering the game with their name as ‚Äúme‚Äù or ‚Äúi‚Äù to beat the System. So you see the system of quick chat is pretty flawed, specially if there‚Äôs a new player in the game that doesn‚Äôt even know how to chat. When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn‚Äôt want to see swearwords or if they wanted to.

For example, if the impostor literally backstabs you, your body could be face down on the floor with their hand reaching out. Or when the impostor impales you with their tongue, it could be a body with a hole in its head. Thanks for reading!

But even though they have been add new updates to Minecraft I feel they haven‚Äôt been adding things that really would make Minecraft wayyyyyyy better. I love the dolphins and turtles but couldn‚Äôt they add a few more like perhaps turkey or peacocks. I know you can easily get mods for these things but some cost money. I also think that they should add more dog breeds if there weren‚Äôt just a wolf I would have a lot more dogs. Like maybe they could have huskies pugs Pomeranians Shibas Chiwawas and Great Danes these are all great dog breeds. They could have which dog you get by the color of the wolf you tame like huskies would be white wolfs and Great Danes could be brown wolfs. I think you should also be able to tame polar bears turtles and dolphins and after you tame them you can saddle them and ride them. I also think that fish bowls should be a thing because if you catch a fish than you can put it in a fish bowl and depending on the amount of glass you use you get a different sized fish bowl.

The game doesn't feel the same after the update, and to any new players, I would no longer recommend it. I've played this game for 7 years now, and I've never been this disappointed. A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever.

Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars.

I start with creative and build everything I want (sometimes I get lucky and find a village) and stock up on everything. I mean EVERYTHING. From food to blocks to animals to weapons, I never want to be caught by a monster in survival without the proper weapon! The villagers are really fun to trade with.

On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names.

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze.

I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.

I think you should also make a new map or an hide and seek map for the people who play hide and seek. Otherwise it‚Äôs great! Also I think there should be a way to friend people, because I met some really nice people , but when I disconnected I never saw them again, they were so nice that when I was Imposter they let me win! But also there is a glitch, I join a game with one player (that‚Äôs what it says) but it turns out to be full! It takes 5-10 minutes to get a game with few players that don‚Äôt curse, (so my friend or little sister can join) and nice settings, and sometimes I click on 2 imposters when I wanted 1 and I clicked on the wrong map, I think we should be able to change the map when we are host, just in case we misclicked, and we should be able  to change the amount of imposters! Also I tried to buy a mini crewmate, but it didn‚Äôt let me, I was really disappointed because all my other friends have mini crewmates and Christmas hats! I couldn‚Äôt buy a single thing in the shop.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme! This game is SUPER fun when you need a blast of adventure and thrill! My rating for this game would be the FULL 5 stars! You Subway Surfer Developers have earned it!

I play this game so much and I became obsessed with getting diamond medals since it‚Äôs so time consuming and I have so much fun trying to get the top Run. Now that the top run table never appears for me I‚Äôve became extremely frustrated. I tried for a week already and nothing works. Also I can‚Äôt compete with my friend who‚Äôs really into this game too, since my Facebook friends won‚Äôt show up. I read somewhere to remove the game from Facebook and then log in into Facebook again, I‚Äôve done that numerous times and it still doesn‚Äôt show my friends. Also after a while of trying to connect the app with my Facebook account, the option of doing so on settings disappeared. I‚Äôm pretty sure there‚Äôs very smart ppl running the game, and I ask that you please look into it. I ask that you please make an update and fix this issue.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later. Like a punishment for acting however they did. But I cannot say that this game is bad. I am really enjoying the newest update very much!

This is not something that is acceptable on a free game but should be corrected immediately on a paid app.  While I enjoy the game, the fact that some many minutes and hours are wasted because games cannot be completed is totally unacceptable.  PLEASE FIX. Really enjoy Monopoly and love the game.  However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.  Since the last update, I have had several games that just freeze and you are out of luck.  What a waste of one, two hours plus, very frustrating.  The other really big issue is if you purchase the color block of Virginia, St Charles and States,  the Houses and Hotels tab covers Virginia and States and there is no way to add Houses and Hotels.  These are the two main issues that I have run into that others have as well.  Hopefully this will be resolved soon.","However reading the reviews, I find two issues that have popped up numerous times on other reviews that I am also experiencing also.",2,True,reliability,negative,7

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn‚Äôt require having to spend money.

When you‚Äôre ranked in the lower levels I‚Äôm convinced this game randomly ‚Äúloosens up‚Äù and you‚Äôre able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I‚Äôm convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game ‚Äútightens up‚Äù and it‚Äôs impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining!

If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use.

Weird I know I took a break from this game for a year and then boom out of no where blew up.  I would always love to think back to 2011 to when I enjoyed this game on an old pc at my grandparents. Now I can‚Äôt stop playing it. All I can say is thank you, bringing us entertainment for all these years. This game has been there sense the start and came out rough into the best sandbox game I have ever played. Sure there are some negatives about the game, like you can‚Äôt get custom skins off files on Xbox without having to decrepit the games files. I always had used MCPE skin creator/editor and it worked amazingly but sad to know I can only do it on mobile. But put that aside, and you have an overall 90/10 game right now for me it‚Äôs perfect as it is. Sadly the original creators of Minecraft are gone and now bough by another company, if your reading this you might say, the new company is bad.

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life. I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.","I don‚Äôt want to give up on this game with not a lot of time put into it already, but if there is no improvement, I might have to.",3,True,efficiency,negative,3

But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

It happens way too often. 2 when playing multiple computer opponents, if the first computer player on the list of players on the right side of the screen goes bankrupt, you can no longer purpose a deal with the other remaining opponent. It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

If I had to change something, I‚Äôd want to make an in game option where if you‚Äôre ready to leave the game but don‚Äôt want to click exit or forcefully run into a train, this will be the option for you. Occasionally in the game, there are already stairs or ramps or whatever going sideways, so it‚Äôs be cool to be able to leave that way. Once you take the stairs, ideally there‚Äôd be a short escape scene, maybe with a mystery box or something, just because it‚Äôd have to be a bit tough to actually get in the stairway or whatever the exit is. It could be a special event/mission! I hope you take this suggestion seriously, because it‚Äôd be AWESOME!!!","To my mind, there aren‚Äôt many ads, they do pop up across the home screen occasionally, but you can X out of those easy enough.",5,True,efficiency,negative,3

For those of you who don‚Äôt have the game what I mean is that people under 18 have to use the quick chat feature instead of saying whatever. But if you‚Äôre over 18 you can use free chat and say whatever you want. I feel that the age limit should be 13 or 14 instead of 18. Like, the majority of this game‚Äôs players are under 18 and I don‚Äôt think that people over 13 really need that level of ‚Äúinternet safety‚Äù protection. Second of all with this new quick chat it takes away some of the things that you want to say about who the imposter is and why you are suspicious of them and whatnot. Some things are so unique you just need to put them in your own words. For example the other day I was playing and I saw Orange running away from a dead body. I reported the body but there was no option to say ‚Äú(A) was running away from the body.‚Äù Some things are so unlikely or one-time happenings that they don‚Äôt have options to say it, but when it does happen you can‚Äôt do anything about it.

When this update first came in I was excited until I found out all the things that I would have to learn it was more confusing than a second grader taking a 12th grade math test. So please remove this feature and go back to the original state. Plus if people were being mean with swearwords people have the option if they didn‚Äôt want to see swearwords or if they wanted to.

Black Bear. A bear with a brown snout, brown belly, and all the rest is black fur. It can only be found in Taiga (spruce forest) biomes. It has the same body that the polar bear does. It eats raw fish of any type and sweet berries, but you cannot tame them, you can only breed them (just like the foxes). They can spawn when the world is in peaceful, easy, normal, or hard. But when it is peaceful, when you attack them they won‚Äôt attack you back. But when it isn‚Äôt in peaceful when you attack one, they deal 4 hearts when the player is in survival. 3. Penguin.

They're pop-up, not videos, so they don't disrupt your game. However, like all games, this one has some problems. My biggest issue is the top run. Every week, the contestants get harder to beat, and eventually you can't get past the last person in the silver because they have over a million. Also, if you get a really good medal, like the diamond, you don't get to keep it for the next week because it changes depending on where you are that week. Another problem is the keys. To revive yourself, you have to pay more and more each time, until it gets so expensive that you can't even afford it. The only way to get keys is in the run, in mystery boxes, or in awards, which is a huge problem because: you only find a key in a run about every eighteen games or so, and if you miss it, then you don't have a chance to get another one. It is extremely rare to get a key in a mystery box, and when you do, it's only one, which can't even begin to pay for the expenses of reviving yourself. It takes a long time to earn a reward, which only gives you three keys, five if you're lucky.

One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours. A few animal ideas are:Bears, birds, snakes, frogs, mice, sharks, squirrel, elephant, lion, monkey, butterfly, crab, deer, penguin, kangaroo, koala, raccoon, alligator or crocodile and more types of dogs.Thank you for reading!","One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen.",5,True,reliability,negative,7

You collect keys and coins over and over until you have enough to unlock that character that you just HAD to have.

You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven‚Äôt played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can‚Äôt get all the characters. Some of them cost money , and some of them you have to have a certain social media for, and some people aren‚Äôt old enough to have FaceBook or whatever.Overall it‚Äôs a fun game but don‚Äôt plan on it being addicting for very long","The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not.",3,True,general,negative,5

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.",I have played this game on my iPad mini 1st generation since the alpha and beta and it has ran smoothly.,3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

As u rank up the more stars  u need to complete ONE task it‚Äôs not fair. Also I downloaded the game mainly to be able to redecorate the house and once you finish the kitchen you get sent outside to build the garden/ greenhouse. It is the most boring part of the game that takes FOREVER to finish. You can finish a room in 1-3 days of completion. But the outside has taken 6+ days to work on and I finally just gave up because of how many unnecessary tasks you have to complete just to get through one day. Every time u think your finally done with the outside theirs something stupid you have to still do. This game is only fun for a few days after that it‚Äôll just make you want to throw your phone in the garbage. Also the amount of coins you get for each level is unbelievable you should be able to get more the higher you level up but nope they just want you to try to buy their packages.

I wouldn‚Äôt give this game anything below 5 stars! But, there are a lot of things that concern me a little to. First, the over usage of bad words and #. It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names. Another thing I would like to suggest is adding friends! Me and my friend just started playing together yesterday but it was very hard to get her into the same game as I am. Sometimes it‚Äôs very boring if we start a new game as host and no one‚Äôs joining!

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion.

On average, I‚Äôm only able to by four, maybe five random properties a game, which doesn‚Äôt even allow me to make any trades at all with other opponents! In fact, in one of my most recent games I ONLY LANDED ON THREE UN-PURCHASED PROPERTIES THE ENTIRE GAME, AND WAS OUT OF THE GAME RATHER QUICKLY!!!

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

Maybe you can add some more interesting updates like a railway crossing with another train intersecting like a cross and the player has to jump through a hole in one of the cars. Or maybe a car crossroad where the cars are driving over the track and the player has to jump on the cars. How about a more interesting above-ground section when you use the jetpack so you can dodge different objects such as trees and parked bicycles.

There are a few problems though. To name a few, when you use an ad to revive, sometimes you will respawn you end up in an area where you are supposed to be on top of a train, so all 3 lanes have trains coming at you just to kill you again and the only way to survive is to waste a board so you can crash into a train. Also, parts of the game don‚Äôt make sense. For example, you‚Äôll jump over a barrier and then you‚Äôll see a train going down the same lane where the barrier is just to run over it. Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin.

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since. I‚Äôve then watched java and bedrock YT videos up until the point when I downloaded PE this April. One thing I did miss about bedrock though was that the ambience noises were removed. I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

So when I spawned into a survival world there was like the unfinished portal thing. Ofc I went to it to loot it and I got a golden pickaxe and sword. When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game!

I‚Äôve been playing it since I was 8 years old, and it‚Äôs come a long way since then. Most games I play I usually play them for about a month or two, three at the most, and then forget about it. But Minecraft is different. It‚Äôs stuck with me for a long time now (almost 6 years). It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both. However, like every game, it does need some improvements. First of all, I suggest that it have a wider variety of animals in the game, (elephants, lions, tigers, sharks, etc). Also, I think their should be more options of furniture, especially in creative mode, rather than having to use steps as chairs. There are also a few glitches that can be annoying. For example, if you add to many mobs in creative, it will lag out your game. Also, there was this one time that I had to delete and reinstall the game because it wouldn‚Äôt let me open up the game.

I Also think this game should have a save game feature because if you are in a game and you have a HUGE score, and your device shuts down by accident, or even just turns off you lose all your progress!! To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that‚Äôs all I have to say on the negative side of things.

The characters are nice and honestly kind of funny. üòÑ and I‚Äôm glad you guys even included pets in the game! I like how everything is tried to kept decorated around the house. I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

Well Austin, being obviously wiser than they, immediately moves back into his parent‚Äôs house and convinces his aging parents to not only stay living in an enormous mansion they can‚Äôt possibly keep up with, but to spare no expense at fixing the monolith up. If that part of the story doesn‚Äôt fry your bacon, then be prepared for pointless  tasks designed to eat up the stars you earn on activities NOT RELATED to repairing the old mansion and the rooms within. The levels require very little strategy; I find the board layout to be purely based on luck and it can take several days or even weeks to beat one, so earning stars to get ahead will truly enslave you to this game. As for the characters; Austin is the know-it-all son, his father a dim-witted buffoon, and his mother has no personality. His relationship with Katherine is uninteresting and ALL other characters are one-dimensional stereotypes. So if any or all of those things appeal to you, download the game.

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.  Overall I enjoy the game but this one needs some work.

I also like the magnet power up because you can get all the coins for a couple seconds without crashing. I also like how you can get keys.  Keys are things that are hard to get but you can get a lot of stuff with them like outfits and hoverboards.  For example, you can get characters with them.  I also like how you can get keys by doing stuff like getting 810 coins in one run you can get 8 keys.  Last of all, I like how you can watch videos to get things.  For example, you can watch a video every day to get two keys and you can also get super mystery boxes by watching videos too.  Last, I like  if you are at 0 coins or 0 keys, you can watch videos nonstop and get 10 keys in 15 minutes or get 10,000 coins in 20 minutes.  As you can see this is a very good game.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun. I'm docking points though, because the storylines are infuriating to deal with. What roped me in to downloading this game was the home decor aspect. As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!? There are TONS of rooms in this house, and after TWO HUNDRED AND FOURTY levels, I'm decorating a garden while so much of the house is untouched. Don't even get me started on the baking storyline. 6 stars just to bake the cake base. Another 3 to bake the house cake. Another 3 to frost it. Another 3 to put it together. Then 2 to drive it to the studio. Then 2 to celebrate the win. Then another 2 to open a present for winning... it doesn't stop! I didn't download the game to bake a cake. I downloaded it to furnish a house! Stop with that nonsense. It took WEEKS to get through that ridiculous storyline.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

The actual game, however, is mostly improving the large house owned by Austin‚Äôs parents.  The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star. The idea of course is to get the player to purchase items to play longer. I get it. Most games I have seen do the same thing, but they don‚Äôt ramp up the difficulty so quickly.","The ads mostly show the lead character, Austin the Butler, in a sticky situation and the player has to pull levers to get him out of it.",3,True,general,positive,5

After I purchased the limited time offer, I was promptly notified that I had been charged $45 dollars instead of the 20 that I thought I was spending.

In order to make it better it would be great if the graphics on the jet pack had less exhaust‚Äîthe moving from side to side with a long trail of exhaust moving as the character does makes it look old, cheesy, and cheap.

I deleted it after reaching level 20. The reason I deleted it is because it‚Äôs too boring to me. It was interesting fixing up the house but having to use multiple stars for some aspects and even to move to the next day is greedy. The bank I despised. Good premise but it holds coins you earn hostage unless you pay to buy it once you accumulate 3000 or 5000 coins. There is no choice either, you watch your coins disappear. The small mini games shown in the ads are the best part but they are way too few and far between. The majority of this game is playing levels over and over trying to get the next star to fix the never ending repairs. I also found having to use stars to open packages annoying. If I‚Äôm getting a gift it should be just. There is some humor and the scenes are colorful which is why i gave it two stars. Had the earning of coins been much higher, the mini games much more prevalent, the bank either free to obtain or at least an option, the limiting of one star per repair and not having to use stars on anything other than repairs I could have seen playing this longer.

I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types).

The chat, I like that you have the quick chat, but I really don‚Äôt like that we still can‚Äôt just type. It‚Äôs so hard to find what you want to say and by the time you find it, everyone has already voted. Also on the Polus map, the names do disappear, but I kinda like it because you can hide. Another thing on the Polus map, the lava is gone, I see the bubbles still but the actual lava is not there. One last thing, when I am a ghost, I sometimes like to go outside of the map, but I noticed that now there is no wall keeping me from going away too far, can you please bring that wall back? Thanks!",Like if you know the person in real life or if you liked playing with them!,5,True,general,negative,5

However I did find more cons than pros. Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server. You have three different maps to choose from. You can also choose if you want to play with 1, 2, or 3 imposters. The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game. I could go on and on but these are the main reasons why I gave it one star",Let‚Äôs start off with finding a server.,1,True,general,positive,5

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme! This game is SUPER fun when you need a blast of adventure and thrill! My rating for this game would be the FULL 5 stars! You Subway Surfer Developers have earned it!

One time, when I was sleeping, it kicked me out. When I went back into the world, it kept me in the sleeping mode. However, whenever I put leave bed, it would kick me out of the app. Some side effects were my avatar got glitchy and laggy. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs my device or not, but I cannot talk about it. Secondly, I would like if we can build all the materials except the blocks, (nether blocks, etc.).

It‚Äôs frustrating having to get kicked out, join back in, and it not being saved. I get kicked out every 5-10 min. Each time I turn off my wifi.

Give bonus random coins for no reason or a closing jackpot at the end of each game or Room.  To spend and spend and never win anything back except 50 coins to 100 coins is disheartening.

The reward to effort is completely unfair. The base reward is 50 coins while the cost for boosts, extended moves, or just about anything is 900 coins or more. Coins are sold in the shop for .99 cents per 900 which is crazy expensive considering 900 coins will on get 5 additional moves or 3 destroy balls (not sure what they are actually called). If 5 mores moves is not enough to complete the level the next 5 cost 1200 coins. The puzzles are designed to require boosts or additional moves. Each puzzle won rewards a star. Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package. All the extra actions not related to actual upgrades seems like a complete waste of stars considering the difficulty of obtaining them.  One good thing added to the game is the option to watch commercials to receive coins.

There needs to be some sort of timer for everything so that way the game can keep moving or if someone doesn‚Äôt make any moves for a long period of time or purposely leaves the game they should go bankrupt and their properties should either get auctioned off or return back to the board for the other people to buy in the future.

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

Before the update was released, people were chatting very easily on the game and I, including others, had no problem with the chat before hand. Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want. This option can give people the chance to communicate better with others. Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were.

So, first off I would like to start this review off with talking about how much I love this game. I downloaded this game years ago and still love it. It‚Äôs ultimately a great game. Here‚Äôs some of my requests you should do. First off, could you guys please make the game where you don‚Äôt need wifi to be able to join people? It always makes road trips boring for me if I want to play minecraft with a friend. Also, if you guys could make it where people can share a wolf. My first wolf from the beginning passed away tonight due to a skeleton attack. Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now. Thank you!",That‚Äôs all my requests for now.,5,True,general,positive,5

It‚Äôs pretty bad when you start a match with no moves and it has to reshuffle. Power ups can be hit or miss at the start. Towards the higher levels you‚Äôll start off with a very small section and you‚Äôll have to open the rest of the field but you‚Äôll end up wasting 3 or 4 moves before you can even do that. Some levels seem impossible to beat without the RNG gods giving you tons of power ups. You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves. If you don‚Äôt have the coins, that‚Äôs when they hit you with the pay to win aspect of it. As many other people have said, it often feels like the game is working against you maliciously so you‚Äôll be forced to buy more coins or power ups. It gets extremely frustrating playing the same level thirty times and losing by 1 move over and over. This is the same for both gardenscapes and homescapes (and probably the other games by the same developers). Bottom lines is you can pretty much tell by mid match if you‚Äôre going to beat the level or not. If you still have 75% of the objectives to complete and you‚Äôve been forced to waste 3 or 4 moves in a row and you have less than 10 moves left, you‚Äôre not gonna win. I usually just quit and start over at that point. No sense continuing if I already know it‚Äôs a dead match.",You‚Äôll often lose by 1 move which prompts you to use coins to buy 5 more moves.,2,True,cost,negative,1

That was before level 1913. I liked it because I could always advance. Beating difficult levels may have taken MULTIPLE attempts but didn‚Äôt require having to spend money. However, within the game there are weekly contests where you‚Äôre placed on teams. The better you do the higher your team level placement. When you‚Äôre ranked in the lower levels I‚Äôm convinced this game randomly ‚Äúloosens up‚Äù and you‚Äôre able to go on winning streaks (doing so allows you to accumulate coins to help Austin fix the house, which is the point of the game, right?). Likewise, I‚Äôm convinced when you do well and find yourself in a higher level, the game ‚Äútightens up‚Äù and it‚Äôs impossible to win any level without spending coin, either real or earned. When I got to level 1913 I got placed in the highest ranking level. Since then I have not been able to get, even close, to beating a level without earning enough extra coins (by watching ads, etc.) to buy my way through. It takes a looooong time to earn those coins!

I have a few suggestions for things you could add or fix. My first thing and biggest thing is a friends list because sometimes when your playing you meet this awesome person but then one of you have to go and you will never see that person that you bonded with again. Another thing is new colors, hats, and pets. I think there should be a wider variety of colors including gray, dark red, light purple, and a tie color could be awesome! There should be additional hats added as well like a set of head phones, glasses, new wigs, and a set of pretty wings. I also think that there should be more pets and pets that you don‚Äôt have to pay for or like watch a certain amount of adds to unlock this pet or do this to unlock this pet. I think they should add a poddle pet, cat, and a bird would be cool. Something that kinda bothers me is that Mirah HQ (probably spelled wrong) doesn‚Äôt have cameras in it. I have also encountered some people who have asked sexual questions and wanted to do sexual activity I know that you can‚Äôt really do anything about that but I wanted to put that out there.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous. The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.","The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.",3,True,effectiveness,positive,2

The sticky situations are called ‚ÄúAustin‚Äôs Bad Dream and in 35 levels, I have only been able to see a few of them.  The game is mostly playing a form of Candy Crush to earn stars in order to improve the home. That part is not so bad. The music is pleasant and the game is a relaxing time waster, at least initially. I don‚Äôt mind using the earned stars to replace furniture or a rug, but as the game goes on, you have to use the stars to do just about anything like answering the door, unpacking a TV, or even starting a new day. And once you‚Äôre out of stars, you can‚Äôt do anything else until you have won more candy crush games and earned more stars. You earn one star from winning each candy crush game no matter how difficult the game is. Win in one round, earn one star. Win after 20 rounds, earn one star.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out. TL/DRThe old app was much better","TL/DR

The levels with soap bubbles or oil spreading while you try to keep it at bay while solving the actual puzzle is ridiculous and next to impossible. Only getting 5 tries at a time to solve a puzzle like that (unless you get a random surprise ‚Äúreward‚Äù of 30-60 mins, or a few hours of unlimited play) is frustrating beyond words. ESPECIALLY when, if you don‚Äôt have time to stop your day to use that surprise time, it goes away.

I thoroughly enjoy the puzzle aspect itself, more so than competing puzzle games. The animations are smoother, the power ups are well thought out and exciting to use, and the puzzles are fun.

As a huge fan of interior design, this seemed like the perfect game for me. I got to play fun levels, but also simultaneously get to decorate a home. However, after spending months on this game, and completing 240 levels, I've only just now unlocked the 3rd room. If you can even call it that. It goes living room, kitchen, and then garden? Why!?

I‚Äôm always gonna be a Minecraft fan. I can‚Äôt wait for the new nether update coming! It‚Äôs advanced the nether A LOT! It‚Äôs just awesome! Plus, Minecraft puts out 2 big awesome updates a year. Seriously, I HIGHLY recommend Minecraft. Not scary, not boring, it‚Äôs VERY fun, even if your not a gamer, there is a 99.9% chance you are going to love it! The best game ever!!! :)","Fight off mobs with weapons, or build a horn your own creative way.",5,True,learnability,positive,6

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay. Some cards do not work as intended, like cards that require paying between players, but most major bugs have been worked out. TL/DRThe old app was much better","A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game.",2,True,effectiveness,positive,2

However, it is far too common for a player to get disconnected or for the game to freeze, ultimately ruining the entire game and leading me to have wasted 2 hours of my time. Also, it is hard to differentiate when a player is simply not paying attention, forgets to roll, or forgets to end their turn so it would be EXTREMELY USEFUL to have a ******chat function****** or at least a button the players could use to notify other players when the game has come to a standstill. I really hope that the monopoly app creators will take these suggestions into account as I have recommended the app to many people and know they have experienced the same frustration as me. Also, it would be awesome if their was a way to pause the game (which I know may actually difficult due to connection issues). Additionally, the game disconnects when someone gets a phone call or even if low battery signal pops up on a players phone. Sometimes the bots will pick up and play for the disconnected user but other times the game is screwed. Regardless, I love how the game is customizable and has great layouts. Love this game, will definitely keep playing, but would profoundly appreciate some improvements given that the Monopoly brand has historically been held with such high regard.",I love monopoly and the app because it takes away the hassle of keeping up with board pieces and having someone act as the bank.,2,True,general,positive,5

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally. I think the last one is the main reason for a lot of issues aside from sound effects.",Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die.,3,True,enjoyability,negative,4

You CAN win every level with out a power up.  You DO NOT need to spend any money on this game, patience is a virtue (so they say).  I have spent money and lately I haven‚Äôt.  The one thing i do agree with most reviewers on is this... to buy a power up costs wayyy too much money for the amount of coins you receive for passing a level.  To continue a game (at 900 coins) for a move or two costs a fortune considering you really don‚Äôt win much.  To buy three hammers costs too much (1900 coins).

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient.

Now I think this could be a good idea, but I have to disagree. You see I think this will discourage players to use the regular typing chat we already have, and for players that A. aren‚Äôt allowed to talk to strangers. And B. Don‚Äôt have a mic, or just are in a crowded room, would not be able to experience the game! Because if they couldn‚Äôt use the voice chat they wouldn‚Äôt be able to hear or talk because everyone would be using the voice chat, the regular chat would be obsolete. And that would make those people stop playing among us! Which would not be very helpful to your company. Also I have read about the hide and seek mode, and really think that should be added along with other modes; because the game as is, gets boring after a month or so. Personally I haven‚Äôt played this game in months because of the lack of variety, I also think a friend system is the #1 thing you need right now because when players who have bonded over a few games are lost to each other forever when they quit/disconnect. All in all it is a very good game with neat gameplay, I just think you need to think about your future because even a game this fun can die fast.

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn‚Äôt work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone. The graphics are also poorer in my opinion as well. Also, whose idea was it to change cap of the multiplier from 30 to 29. It makes no sense to change a longstanding norm.","Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard?",1,True,reliability,negative,7

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement.

Well Austin, being obviously wiser than they, immediately moves back into his parent‚Äôs house and convinces his aging parents to not only stay living in an enormous mansion they can‚Äôt possibly keep up with, but to spare no expense at fixing the monolith up.

This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,Like 498 level I am not going to spend anymore money on this game.,2,True,cost,negative,1

I play to earn the keys and coins through the challenges they give.  And will spend an hour of playing. Using all the available means they give to multiply your scores and boost yourself.  And it simply just takes too much gameplay to earn what they are charging for the items in the store.   You want to just charge me $9.99 for the full game and release most boards and outfits to me.

I‚Äôve played many games, but this one has become my favorite. Over time though, I am beginning to get frustrated! You only get about 50-80 coins a game after completing the level, but in order to get more chances to play it‚Äôs 900 coins for the first 5 extra moves and then goes up to 1200. I don‚Äôt even know what‚Äôs after that, because it‚Äôs just so much! Even with the rewards they grant, you only get 100 coins which is like nothing. You really have to spend money to play this game. I‚Äôve tried to be patient and play the games out without spending money, but many levels you just can‚Äôt! I don‚Äôt mind spending the money here and there, but it‚Äôs so expensive, it doesn‚Äôt even make it worth it. You get 1000 coins for .99 and it takes 900 coins to get 5 extra turns. That adds up really quick! Plus it‚Äôs even more expensive if you want power ups! I‚Äôm not too sure how much more I can continue playing if they don‚Äôt make some changes. It‚Äôs beginning to add up with how many coins I‚Äôve been buying just to beat rounds. On top of that I believe that there are also sometimes when the board isn‚Äôt applying the power ups correctly. It's almost like a glitch or something that‚Äôs not working. I‚Äôm really hoping they make some changes to this game!

Here is why I left off two stars#1: Let me set the scene: You‚Äôve seen everybody else have subway surf, so you beg your mom to let you get it. She says yes, so you go to the App Store and download it. You start playing and realize how addicting it is!! You play nonstop for hours. *2 months later* You haven‚Äôt played in a bit, so you open up the app and start playing. You instantly get bored. The problem with this game is that you do the same thing over and over again, different setting or not. It gets very boring. #2: You can‚Äôt get all the characters.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

When I went to go mine coal it gave me the ore blocks instead of just coal. I didn‚Äôt think much of it until I went to go mine iron and it gave me nothing! This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people?

Also, can you add a new character: Toon Bot?Toon Bot would be the normal robot body, like tagbot and tankbot,Just a few design changes. For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

It defaults to try to make a trade with the bankrupted player with no option to change it to the other player, so the only way to trade is to wait for the computer to strike a trade with you and then counter the trade. 3 when you get a card that says each player pays $10 for a birthday or whatever, the money never comes out of the players account. Maybe that‚Äôs because of the free parking rule. Not sure. 4 if you use up all of the houses so that there aren‚Äôt any more in reserve, and then sell a hotel, more houses Automatically appear.

There are a few suggestions that I would like to make though. The first suggestion is decreasing the prices for the avatars. I just think they‚Äôre a little bit expensive. Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme! This game is SUPER fun when you need a blast of adventure and thrill! My rating for this game would be the FULL 5 stars! You Subway Surfer Developers have earned it!

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

Then a door will appear out of no where to take you back to the over world when you are ready. This will also contain Force oars and on and on. 3rd, A time traveler. If you kill a wither, enderdragon, and forden, they will drop something called Broken map. If you place the three pieces together it will unlock something called a time traveler.

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

Before the update was released, people were chatting very easily on the game and I, including others, had no problem with the chat before hand. Ever since the update was released, there is always little no none chatting when discussing who the imposter might be. Also, a way to make this less of a problem is to give people the option to not use the new chat so they could type what they want. This option can give people the chance to communicate better with others. Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were. Discussing who the imposter is a pain because you basically have no clue who the imposter might be because no one uses the new chat. This game has become quite boring because of the update and I think it would have done just fine without the new update.

For a half of a year, practically nothing was added. If you cannot maintain the game properly, then you should sell it to a company that can. Third is the community. Although the developers cannot control this, it still makes the game a bad experience for many players. You may have added what I am about to say already, but if you didn‚Äôt, you should add a age restriction. There are a lot of people that play Among Us who are not very smart and accuse people for no reason and everybody listens without any evidence.

Stars are required to perform actions for upgrading the garden or home. Though it is satisfying to watch the transformations and improvements I get frustrated when required to spend a star to greet someone at the door to receive a package, then another star to open the package.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

For the head, it would be a screen like a TV, changing facial expressions. The TV head would glitch, or bug out whenever the player is caught or damaged. The second costume for Toonbot would be a retro, video game style with a more modern, clean tv instead of an old, 1990 style tv. It would come with a new board witch would simply be a TV remote, special purchasable powers for the board would be zap sideways and super speed. This might add a but of modern-day style to the game.

Would be nice to see the city in 3D more often during gameplay. The ‚Äúyour turn‚Äù banner obstructs the dice momentarily. The dice should never be obstructed. When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes.

The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week.

I often keep my tablet in monochrome setting and for the most part this doesn‚Äôt inhibit game play as the shapes are so different. However the ice bombs are all the same shape and in grayscale I cannot tell them apart as they are too close in tone to their one another and not identical in tone to the matching shape. It is frustrating.On a completely different note. I am convinced Austin is dead and this whole game is an afterlife experience. Otherwise the back story of him as a butler (second generation no less) whose family as this fabulous history and mansion makes very little sense. The butler conceit causes other problems as well. I HATE having to spend stars to sweep or dust when Austin sweeps to ‚Äúalienate boredom,‚Äù and often enough to warrant concerns about it being an obsessive behavior... maybe he isn‚Äôt dead, maybe his parents sent him to a special program for individuals with extreme obsessive behavior, the Institute wasn‚Äôt a school for butlers, it was an institution for individuals with special needs such as delusional thinking and obsessive behavior.",It is frustrating.,4,True,general,negative,5

The computer makes trades amongst themselves that aren‚Äôt fair, they‚Äôre only helping each other get sets to knock you out of the game. If you have hotels, the AI WILL NOT LAND ON THEM. Only between your hotels. It‚Äôs laughable at how predictable it is. If a 6 will land you on their hotel, you will roll that 6. I had a property of every color in my last game to ensure no one can build, so what happens? Yup, I land on their railroads only. So what do I do? I buy one of their railroads for a ridiculous price. The next turn, the computer acquired a railroad from another computer to re up the price. I know what you are thinking, why wouldn‚Äôt they buy that railroad prior so that they had all 4? Nah, only when I take the railroad away are they ALL OF A SUDDEN interested. It‚Äôs insanity how much they fix the games in favor of the computer.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game. Also, players sometimes stop playing, and there‚Äôs no warning or way to resign without stopping the game for everyone. In spite of these flaws, it‚Äôs a fun game, but there‚Äôs room for improvement. Personally, I‚Äôm waiting for these issues to get addressed before investing more money in a Season Pass.","This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment.",3,True,enjoyability,positive,4

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on. Very disappointed!",When the ai did land it was a surprise.,3,True,general,positive,5

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though. So, if you can fix it, please do.",I‚Äôve been playing Minecraft PE since 2011 and it‚Äôs awesome!,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I like Homescapes much better than gradenscapes just because the colors and the graphics are better int my opinion. At least the game is a little better.     The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

When you only win between 50 and 100 coins ( on a really good round) it takes a really long time to recoup. They are very stingy with giving you boosters and chances to get more coins. I play other games that are very generous with coins and boosters which allows me to play and enjoy the game. Isn‚Äôt that what the game should be all about? Challenging levels are one thing, but when it takes so many lives to win a level it‚Äôs not fun anymore. I won 2 hours, played constantly for that time and only made it through 2 levels.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.  Overall I enjoy the game but this one needs some work.

It‚Äôs so fun and the strategy involved makes it more exciting to play. It also gives such a rush of adrenaline. But whilst this game is structured beautifully and an incredible game, I do have a few small tips that I think could make this game better than it already is. First of all, an add friend button. Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

I recently beat the ender dragon in the bedrock version, so I decided I wanted to to stay at the credits screen and read it all the way. Which actually happened. The way the credits screen was written out really had me speechless just because of how simply powerful the language makes you imagine about life, and imagining how far you may go.  I never really thought about life that deep before, when I was still very young, but now that a few years have passed, I definitely have developed a drastically deeper understanding for Minecraft. I believe that Minecraft just isn‚Äôt a sandbox game where you can let your imagination and creativity raise the bar as high as you want, but I honestly think it‚Äôs more than just a game.

But ever since Character Creator has been added to the game, my custom skins have been looking off. I use slim-armed skins because I prefer them over classic skins but the glitch only occurs on slim-armed skins. Let‚Äôs say you have a slim-armed skin, and you wanted a unique design on each leg. Like different-lengthened socks, or a flower on one and a star on the other. Then when you upload the skin on the game, whatever way you designed the right leg (it looks like the left leg if you look straight at the skin) gets copy and pasted automatically onto the left leg (right leg if you look at the skin straight at the face). It looks distorted, as I don‚Äôt know if other players can or cannot see the error besides yourself, but it‚Äôs basically both legs are symmetrical while a lot of skin designers like not making symmetrical, and the second layer on the leg that gets changed to looking like the other stays. So basically the glitched leg looks exactly like the other leg that looks perfectly fine, but has second layer on it. Like then both legs would have like a flower on it but the star‚Äôs second layer is stuck on top of the copy and pasted flower. Pretty odd right? For me it makes me feel like I have OCD, I can‚Äôt stand skins that have something off on it, sorry. It doesn‚Äôt do the glitch on classic skins though.

Board games in reality are fixed in many ways. For example, a deck of cards with a discard pile ensured that every card in the game will be played before a player can draw a second copy of any card. This also ensures equal odds of getting a card. This app takes the simpler approach of randomly generating the card on each draw. This means you may draw cards like ‚ÄúSpeeding Fine‚Äù two or three times in a row, while never pulling ‚ÄúAdvance To...‚Äù cards of any kind. The odds of card drawing seem to also favor the weaker cards. The developers assure that‚Äôs not true, but an easy way to restore faith would be to have the cards work with an actual deck and discard system instead of random generation upon each draw. To me, the purpose of this is to mimic the board game, if you wanted to change the fundamentals of the game then a different game mode would be nice. A ‚ÄúRandomized‚Äù mode could be fun along with the original two, but I would want the ‚ÄúClassic‚Äù mode to run like the classic board game. Otherwise, the game is functionally okay.

I didn‚Äôt think it was I big deal at first until I hit a brick wall. You see, I was trying to buy a house on States Avenue and with the ‚Äòimprovements to the interface‚Äô they‚Äôd added, the stupid Buy Houses button completely covered up the property, so good luck putting a house on States Avenue! (or Virginia Avenue, for that matter!) These ‚ÄòImprovements‚Äô make it very hard to see what I was doing at times, but make it impossible to do certain things to other times. This makes the game virtually unplayable at times, particularly making certain plays like trading or mortgaging property or buying/selling houses.

A lot of people are COMPLAINING about the new update showing the surroundings in the location of Little Rock! I don‚Äôt know why people are so pressed, i like when the new updates come out because i can see a different map/scenery of the game while playing. Like seeing different colored trains, different buildings, etc. Because I don‚Äôt like seeing the same thing forever, you know? Getting straight back to my point, the update is fine. I saw this one review saying it looked like a kid drew it out. I was reading and comparing to the actual update and I did NOT agree! It‚Äôs a nice update and I like seeing different places in subway surfers! Thanks subway surfers for allowing us to get a different place every update! It means you care and you don‚Äôt want you viewers to get too bored with the same game style every day!

It keeps kicking me out before I even get a chance to play a game. For instance, I was playing with a bunch of my friends on a call, and right when the game started, it kicked me out and I didn‚Äôt get to play. But luckily, I have it on my computer and I still got to play, but not for a couple of rounds. Maybe it‚Äôs just my phone, but maybe not. 2. We need friends in the game. Let me explain. If you play like 5 games in a row with someone and you‚Äôre bonding with them, maybe you have to go or maybe they have to go, or if you get kicked or something, you never get to see each other ever again. Also it could be the same thing except with friends. And maybe you can see if you‚Äôre friends (in the game) are playing. 3. Newer stuff, like new colors, tasks and hats would be absolutely amazing! I have seen that the developers are working on a new map. 1 question about that. Is it gonna be a hide and seek map? If so that would be the most wonderful thing! Or even just another map even if the one you‚Äôre working on isn‚Äôt a hide and seek one. I love Among Us and all its features. I very much respect everyone that works on it, and I know it‚Äôs hard.

If you‚Äôve seen any ad for this game then you‚Äôve probably saw the ‚Äúpull the the pins‚Äù type of gameplay presented to draw you in. That‚Äôs NOT what this game is. That type of gameplay is so small & almost insignificant that it‚Äôs pretty shady for them to put that at the forefront of their advertising. If you had to pay upfront for this game, I‚Äôm pretty sure there would be grounds for a lawsuit; it‚Äôs THAT bad. What this game is centered on is the much more generic Candy Crush, ‚Äúmatch the tiles‚Äù type gameplay. The reason I don‚Äôt give it a 1-star is because they have actually made this generic premise fun, and put some admirable twists into the formula (at least I think. I don‚Äôt play many mobile games and especially match tile types). Interesting challenges, creative power-ups you can make if you‚Äôre smart, genuinely challenging puzzles (in a fun way), admirable special effects & sound design. Doesn‚Äôt SEEM to try to force its way into your wallet (from the 12hrs I‚Äôve put into the game thus far) in terms of gameplay, but it does do plenty of in-game marketing.If this game was honest about what it really was, I‚Äôd give it 4-stars.

There are 2 that really stick out. The first one starts once you get to about 100k score, but gets more prevalent once you get to about 250k. What it happens is, when you jump from the ramp up onto the train, and land on the train, you stay floating, and it won‚Äôt let you jump or roll, once you go to the left or right, it‚Äôs fixed though. That doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs fine though, because if you don‚Äôt notice it, it might kill you. The second, and worse of the two comes down to the hit-boxes. This just happened to me right before writing this review. On top of the trains, sometimes you just want to go left or right, but when you try, you stumble into nothing. That just happened to me... two trains in a row and it got me killed. Luckily I had just started the round and it seems to happen in the early stages most often so at least it‚Äôs hard to ruin your high score with that glitch, but that one is much more annoying because you can‚Äôt avoid it. There are a few others that aren‚Äôt as bad, for example, earlier I had super sneakers on and went into a jet pack, paused the game for a bit, then I started running in the air with the jet pack on.

They should really listen and make some serious changes to fix what could be a wonderful game. I think the developers should fix the game so the power ups are on the side so you can choose when to use them, and if you have any left they should be useable on the next level. I think the developers need to really read the reviews and seriously think about making some changes. One change, let us choose when to use our boosts or power ups.

Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play.

Now, after updating the game from not playing it for over a year, the game lags for seemingly no reason (it runs smoother with the internet turned off and turning off multiplayer seems to make little difference). Some sounds are still present in the game but some sounds don't play at all such as picking up blocks or when you get hurt or die. Enemies do not make unique sounds when hit and has a seemingly stock sound effect playing. I have not had problem with infinite maps before; however, I now have problems with all maps. The game only feels playable when all high end settings are disabled, mob spawning is disabled, and setting gameplay to peaceful. In addition, the UI is not touch screen friendly like it was in the alpha and beta. I know that I am using old hardware but this many problems for a game that ran otherwise smoothly in the past is ridiculous. One final criticism is that unlike the alpha and beta there are only two rendering options that make the hot bar look pointless: 5 and 6. Make it 1 to 6 so that old players such as myself can play the game optimally.

Also, the restrictions on what you can type in the chat like ‚ÄúAdmin‚Äù can lead to others thinking you were in Admin but that was where the murder was, not where you were.

I have come across some really disgusting conversations within the game between people. If kids starting from the age of 9+ can play this game there should be a way to report people saying explicit inappropriate things. Each person should get a profile and there should be a system of reporting people. Yes you can kick people out of a server but you have to also get three other people to do too or be the one who made the server. There needs to be a better system in place. There has been a time where I entered a server and someone was trying to get personal information out of a 12 year old (at least that is how old the person said they were). That is NOT okay. Luckily other people within the server stepped in and we told the kid not to share that information but there really needs to be a system in place. There have also been times of people bullying other people. This is also not okay and just another reason there needs to be a way to report people for misconduct. I did not find this game to have a safe environment for me or for children. It is a great concept but not at all what I would consider safe for children at the age of 9.

The game can stop and crash at any point in the game. I wasted 2 hours playing a round just so it could crash mostly every single time. Out of the 35 games I‚Äôve played, I only got through 7 of them. Mind you, I had to pay for this app. It‚Äôs ridiculous. DONT BUY THIS APP unless they start making changes and improvements to it. Also they do not have any type of communication system so you can‚Äôt talk to your opponents. That should be included in the game to communicate with your opponents, negotiate for trades, or just to simply remind your opponents to end the game. There are many more flaws that takes away the authentic feeling of playing the boardgame Monopoly.

Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play.

It‚Äôs a great game to play with friends and family, whether you want to create a massive structure or survive in the wilderness while fighting monsters, or do a bit of both.

There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.

BUT I have some requirements. Number one is EMOJIS. We really need some emojis to express how we fell and to make talking with others easier. I mean I‚Äôm trying to make faces with text and it doesn‚Äôt let me. Mostly it would just make talking with others more fun. Number two is microphone. We should be able to make the settings of a game to be microphone only because honestly it‚Äôs easier and takes less time to talk. Number three hide and seek game mode. I know you guys mentioned this when you announced Among Us 2 but you have cancelled it so I hope you add it to Among Us 1. Number four updates. Now I‚Äôm not complaining that mobile players get updates later I‚Äôm just saying that at the time I‚Äôm typing this everyday I get into an among us lobby at least once it says I need to update and then I go to the App Store and I can‚Äôt update. Now I don‚Äôt know how updates for this game work since I‚Äôve never experienced an actual update for it before. And the rest that I have are the thing u mentioned for Among Is 2 so I really hope u add all your ideas that you all had for Among Us 2 in Among Is 1. I understand that these things are probably difficult to do but I really think that these would make the game better. But then again I‚Äôm not a game creator so I don‚Äôt know how this is.

The chances for triple doubles are extremely high when you put it against the odds from doing some simple math. After the building phase, everybody just goes to jail most of the time. It‚Äôs almost impossible to play with conventional Monopoly techniques because of the rigged chances of the dice, and having to deal with random obnoxious bots online, even if you chose to play with real people. This game has too many bugs and too few features. Online Multiplayer never works, they‚Äôve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game. The animation is also way too long and it‚Äôs been frustratingly improbable trying to play with others online. And the fact that the game is server-sided does not change the developers‚Äô minds to at least rent a competent server, because from what I‚Äôve witnessed throughout the last few months, the servers have been utter trash. And the monopoly Hasbro has over this game makes this distillation of laziness and greed the only game of its kind on App Store, leaving you no choices but to buy it if you want to play this 100-year-old board game. It‚Äôs just ridiculous.oh yeah btw, you can‚Äôt trade anymore given that the new version has this freaking bug that player just automatically rejects your offer. what a genius feature","Online Multiplayer never works, they‚Äôve got tons of bots and it always freezes, forcing all players to force quit the game.",1,True,reliability,negative,7

But recently the game was updated so that anyone under the age of 18 can not type what they want or need to say. I see that they were trying to fix the problem of swearing and online dating but it just wasn‚Äôt the right way to fix the problem. The game used to be so enjoyable, and now I probably won‚Äôt be playing it again. There are many other ways to fix this problem, but restricting what people can type so that they can‚Äôt get their point across is not the way to do it. If this was removed I definitely would give it a 5 star review, but unfortunately this update has ruined the game for me, my friends and my family.EDIT: I won‚Äôt be playing the game again I‚Äôve tried to get over the update but I can‚Äôt. To be honest you ruined your own game. The bulk of people that play are teens and now we have no freedom. We get all of these restrictions everywhere and you had to add among to that list. I‚Äôm very disappointed. If you could lower the age for safe chat from 18 to 13 that would be great. 18 is very unrealistic compared to 13 which is much more reasonable. Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

Another thing is sometimes bodies that are next to a door that‚Äôs closed, you can‚Äôt see the body not that big of a deal but I‚Äôve gotten voted of bc of it one time, idk if this was a glitch but I think the guy was modding or something but I was in admin on the skeld and the report button popped up but there wasn‚Äôt a body another guy was in there as well and even said there wasn‚Äôt a body on his screen either idk if it was a bug or a modder but I got voted off for it and it frustrated me quite a bit other bugs as well but there not really a big deal because there only there for a min or 2 and the game still operates as it should... plus teaming is a big issue but there‚Äôs not really anything you can do about that.other than these things amazing game definitely recommend.

After I purchased the limited time offer, I was promptly notified that I had been charged $45 dollars instead of the 20 that I thought I was spending.

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game.

But Pass and Play is a fun way to pass time when you're traveling with someone or are waiting on an appointment, and playing the AI can still be a fun experience as well.

I have been playing this game since i was little, my grandmother introduced me to the game and I got pretty addicted. But, in my opinion that just goes to show this game is for ALL ages and everyone can enjoy it. So again please don‚Äôt blame the game for those that have worked hard to permanently earn a spot in gold/diamond. If you made it to the end of my LONG review, thanks for reading my report. And for those who have never had the game, I really suggest this to anyone of any gender or age.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all. I personally still love this game to freaking pieces so keep up the good work Mojang.",So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.,5,True,general,positive,5

I understand that in monopoly, the process of coming out on top and owning the entire board is satisfying enough by itself, however I feel that some reward or banner would be cool to include into the game. For instance, the load in screen could have small ribbons or stats or banner that shows that either this player has won quite a bit and will be a challenge or that they have accomplished certain challenges, such as winning multiple games in a row.

I don't want to stop playing but I run out of lives so I have no choice. Lol. I think I like it better than Gardenscapes and I love Gardenscapes too.  I like how you can put different types of explosives together or two of the same to make a bigger explosive. It would be even greater if you could put more than two together. I've had three explosives lined together but I can't mix all three together. I haven't had 4 or more alined but that would be more awesome. With Gardenscapes it seems like I'm not able to complete and able to upgrade or rebuild anything as quickly as I seem to be able to with Homescapes. So if you wanted to change something with Gardenscapes that would be one thing.  I guess it's a little harder to complete a level. You can't mix two explosives like you can with Homescapes. It's just totally different with the match game with Homescapes it seems to me. I love it and I can't get enough of it. I'm always wondering what the next level is going to be like.

They are annoying at worst and a wonderful addition for shrewd dealing humans, at best. The klunky repetitious and nonsensical ‚Äúoffers‚Äù they make are pretty bad. And the fact that they only assess deals based on value of the deeds and classifying them as ‚Äúeasy, medium, or hard‚Äù just improves their luck and reduces yours makes them pretty frustrating at times.

Me and my friends love playing servers together and being able to friend other users could make it easier to game together. Also a microphone feature would be great. Chatting with the other users whilst playing out loud could be really great, because you‚Äôd be talking instead of typing through a screen. You‚Äôd be able to pick a game with microphone chatting or without, just whatever you prefer personally. Also being to branch out into private chats with people in the server would be really good. That way you could discuss plans with fellow imposters and win in a better and more strategized way. Also you could chat with friends you‚Äôre playing with separately. It would add a better feature of strategy and even betrayal to the game. You could even use it for persuasion purposes.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

You can spend hours playing it, HOWEVER... as you increase in levels it starts to become less fun.

Not to mention the coins, you only get at max about 100 coins depending on what level you beat, but if you want extra moves it 900 coins!!! Ok, you do the math.... when it‚Äôs all said and done you have to spend money on extra lives to beat the boards, on coins to advance in the levels and get the stars you need in order to fix things to advance!  As the boards get harder we should get more stars, Hard=2 stars, Super Hard=3 stars and so forth, as we advance in the game tasks cost more stars so we should naturally EARN more stars to off set it!  Not keep us at 1 star per level, but the higher we go tasks are costing us 6-12 stars PER TASK, come on!! Same with the coins!

I find them to be fun and even addicting. Although the concept of the game is great, and I‚Äôve only been playing for a short while, something needs to be improved with the coin/lives system. Getting around 50 coins per mini-game, which can take multiple lives to complete, isn‚Äôt sufficient enough. In order to buy a life, 900 coins, you would have to play around 18 rounds just to get enough coins for ONE life. I do not pay money on games, never have never will, but it‚Äôs so frustrating that you may have one move left and instead of paying real cash, not in game coins, you have to wait for a life to replenish just to try and fail at the level again. Each round can take 10+ lives to complete, and it takes quite awhile for the lives to replenish. There should be some kind of reward opportunity other than completing a day, especially because you need to play the mini-games to get stars, in order to complete tasks, to complete the day. That‚Äôs a lot of tasks to do with not a lot of lives/coin rewards!!! If there were events where you can play other mini-games to gain rewards/treasures I think it would be more efficient. I also think 28 minutes is a long time to wait for one single life.

I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices.

No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server? I don‚Äôt appreciate having to pay $7 for a game I can‚Äôt even play. I tried everything and nothing seemed to work.

When adding houses to the purple properties, the add houses button extends over the purple properties making it difficult to add properties there. I find myself accidentally not buying a property because the buy or not buy buttons are too close together. Maybe a different layout for buying properties. For games against the computer it would be nice to limit the number of times the computer offers a trade. It gets to the point where it is offering trades on every dice roll which slows the game down. For the custom rule set, having an option to start the game with more money would be nice.

After playing almost 20 single player matches I found some major flaws. The most annoying being the roll of the dice is not random. I understand that anything can happen in a dice roll but it seems the dice rolls are scripted. To prove this I played a single player match against one ai player on easy. I controlled all property and railroads from the go square to free parking, yes that includes the orange properties!  The opposing side only had boardwalk and park place. We both had hotels on all monopolies owned. For a numbered point of reference that‚Äôs 13 out of 20 to one side while the ai had 2 out of 20 on the opposing side. I recorded 12 cycles and I landed 8 out of 12 cycles on either one of his two squares while the ai landed only 9 times on my 13 squares out of the 12 cycles. Almost every cycle I landed on his two properties and yet many times the ai only landed on a chance, just visiting, income tax, or community passing through unscathed on my side of the board. When the ai did land it was a surprise. I‚Äôve played enough games to realize there is some scripting going on.

The story lines are cute as well.  Some of the story items cost way too much compared other games and honestly nothing should cost more than 2 stars, let alone stuff that costs 6.

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

Trains will also appear out of nowhere. Keys are another huge problem. They are so rare to find and then if you don‚Äôt want to watch an ad to revive, you have to pay at least one key. As you keep dying, you need more and more keys to the point where the amount needed is insanely high.

I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said ‚Äúloading‚Äù. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review. I cannot enjoy games that I cannot play. I switched my character back to zoey and it works just fine now. But I want your company to fix ‚Äú the tank bot problem‚Äù. Thank you üôèüèª!

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous. The game is so fun, and after reading a lot of reviews I do think the game should be updated and should fix these problems.","Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups.",3,True,general,positive,5

Yet with this disgustingly glitchy Xbox live sign in and sign out if you‚Äôre still signed in you can‚Äôt even play without WiFi. How awful. Plus the world I was trying to get into didn‚Äôt even have Xbox achievements. So fantastic job, just fantastic. Now I have to sign in, sign out every time I get WiFi.

It‚Äôs super fun even when your not playing with friends. I know many people have an opinion on this (most of them good) so I just thought I spread the word even more. I feel like you should really add a friend system! That way you can send friend requests to people you would like to join‚Äôs game. Something that I find very annoying, is when your in the middle of playing, then get kicked out and it says: ‚ÄúSent 6 pings‚Äù or the ‚Äúunreliable packet source‚Äù or something. Its really annoying how you can be playing and then boom. Back to the main menu you go! So that‚Äôs something I would like if you fixed it. And finally, the trolls. I hate when people will join a game and ask ‚Äúhey any (insert gender) here?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs ur snap?‚Äù ‚ÄúHey how old are you?‚Äù It‚Äôs really uncomfortable. Also when people say inappropriate things like private things to other strangers. It gets me disgusted. So I thought something thst could help with that is banning. If someone is beign really rude,or innapropriate I (and many others) would appreciate it if the game can ban them for maybe 30 minutes. So they can still play, but it‚Äôs later.

The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often. I know the creators can‚Äôt control what people say, but it would be nice if they could be reported for it. Overall, I love among us but I would love to see these three things added. P.S.

When I got back on Minecraft, I got to my settings, but the add-on wasn't in the Resource Packs setting thingymajober. I got confused. I went to Storage, and I saw the Better Drops add-on. Except that it won't let me activate it. That's weird. Please tell me how to activate behavior packs. Also, I have a suggestion. Minecraft just got boring because there were no other items that are really decorative, like when you want to build a house, you needed a toilet. But there is no toilet in Minecraft. Mods like Decocraft mod and Bibliocraft mod have many other items that are decorative for a house, but sadly there are no mods for Minecraft PE. What I mean by this is that mods don't work on Minecraft PE. There are only Addons, but really Addons just REPLACE other items. Please add more items like toilets or TVs and more in Minecraft!

For a relatively simple game, it creates surprising amounts of tension, and with the right group of players, the experience can be a total blast. So, why the mediocre rating? Innersloth recently released what I can only describe as a ruinous, game-breaking update. Firstly, disconnections are frequent; in a game whose structure relies upon every player living long enough to cast out the killer(s) before meeting either win/loss condition, losing those players to disconnection means one less pair of hands for tasks, one less vote per meeting, one less identity to hide among, or one less partner to kill crewmates. If it were just one, a person could grouse and learn to get over it. But it is many. The problem is large enough to merit redress. And there are game-ending graphical errors, too. From time to time, avatars glitch through/into walls, or walk into out-of-bounds areas. I even lost a game once where I thought I broke another player‚Äôs alibi because she claimed to be someplace, but she was plainly visible right next to me. Turns out she wasn‚Äôt a liar‚Äîmy game was just glitchy. Post-game glitches often mean rebooting and losing your lobby, which is the end of the world, but can be really demoralizing when you finally find a cool group to play with.

This level it has the regular white blocks that grow but the purple ones you have to kit them 2 to 3 times and they grow back just one to two moves after you remove another side. To get extra coins for more lives or boosters it is a lot of money for what little you get. 900 coins you get 3 this. And 1900 coins you get 3 globes. The lives run out so fast and sometimes my friends send me lives I see them and play one game go back to collect the life because it won‚Äôt allow you to have 6 life‚Äôs and it is missing. I am in the room right at the stairs I forget what it is called. Looks like another living room to me. The outside green house it felt like it took years to finish the plot line. I wish you could request the boosters but place them where you want them if you want them in the game. Like they would be added to your side menu but not dropped down in the puzzle because it places them and there would be a awesome move but the boosters messed it up and you only can use the boosters there is no other move.,900 coins you get 3 this.,2,True,cost,positive,1

I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something.

As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

It helps me when I get home from school. Hands down this is the best game ever, and if you‚Äôre reading this you should definitely get it. It has structures to explore, over 30 biomes, achievements to get, about 85, you can playin friends worlds, in your own worlds, and if you sign in to Xbox live you can pay on servers with players across the globe. You can play worlds in survival or creative, with cheats on or off. The 5 default servers are The Hive, Lifeboat, Mineplex, Mineville City, and Cubecraft games. But there are tons of other servers around too. It constantly updates proving it won‚Äôt go out of business for a whiiiiiiiiiiile. If you‚Äôre looking for an awesome game, get Minecraft.Suggestion:	Maybe in the create world slot you could add more textures and not just the default. You could add past tense, or future tense, or Realistic Minecraft, whatever you want. And possibly, could you eventually add more bosses. Knowing the fact when you beat the Wither and Ender Dragon, there‚Äôs not really anything else to do. Really you could just go to end city, get achievements, that‚Äôs really all that‚Äôs important left. And maybe you could add some guns in the game.

A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out.

The first one is a friends system because it would be a lot easier to join a friend‚Äôs game if you could just click ‚Äòjoin game‚Äô like in roblox. A second thing I would love to see added is a currency like coins or maybe something more creative like aliens. Then, players should receive say, 5 aliens or coins if they win as a crew mate and 10 aliens or coins if they win as imposter. Then, I think players should be able to use these coins/aliens to buy hats or outfits. I also think it would be really cool if we could use this currency to buy higher imposter chances because I would love if I could do that. The third and final thing I would love to see added is a report button. This would be good because I have noticed that some people say weird or disturbing things in my games quite often.

As far as games go this is the most addicting mobile game I‚Äôve personally played. I‚Äôve enjoyed it  since this game came to iOS and have even purchased some in-game cosmetic gear. I just wanna say I appreciate the devs don‚Äôt give any pay to win options in the game. Some of the tasks are annoying and the maps need balancing I think. Other than that I think the gameplay is the strongest aspect of this game as it preys on our natural suspicions of others and that‚Äôs an amazing concept for strangers and friends to play. The biggest problem I‚Äôve had though, and the reason for the 3 star rating is due to the fact that I can hardly even get matches when I want to. I get error messages often saying I was dropped from the server or that the matchmaker is full. As someone who has put money into this game I find this unacceptable. I understand the rare server issue here and there but when it takes over 20 minutes to search for game I feel like I‚Äôm literally wasting time. This game was the number one ranked action game at one point and there are ads at the end of every match. Surely the devs need to work out a better deal with their current sponsors.

The puzzles and all were really fun. But I just don‚Äôt like the fact that every little thing you do cost multiple stars and so you have to complete multiple levels to do the simplest things that honestly shouldn‚Äôt cost a star at all. Really thought the game would be more focused on designing the house. Not the garden or paying attention to what‚Äôs going on in town. Additionally, I understand the game is supposed to be challenging. But who honestly has time to spend weeks trying beat a single level to continue on with the game. Some levels are literally so difficult that the user ends up frustrated and just closing the game out for the day. Sure I‚Äôve spent a fair amount on money trying to beat those select levels. And I see some user reviews that talk about spending a huge amount of money. But who honestly has time to devote that much energy into a game as well as waste money trying to get through a level just to get stuck and have to spend more money again later on a higher level. Really think the developers should have an option to just skip one if they can see you have tried 100 times and still can‚Äôt get past.

It is fun and easy to learn how to play, and it kills time while making us think. I believe the new tournaments are fun, but it needs more. The levels need to make it so more coins can be earned. If I earn the minimum coins per level (50) and play 10 levels, it still isn‚Äôt enough to get a retry on a particularly hard level. Now I do think the fact they are called ‚ÄúHard Levels‚Äù makes it better for us to prepare, and definitely the coin amount there is worth it. But in order to pass a level, I spend almost 6-8 hearts if it‚Äôs extremely time-consuming and hard. There is still the issue with more prizes. I like the daily bonus, but after the seventh day, it sent me right back to the first day without any prizes. I believe it should be after the 7th day, you get all the prizes from day 1-6 at the same time, and then day 8 and on should have more until you reach every seventh day again. It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game. There also need to be more tournaments that don‚Äôt give prizes based off places. I never get first place in the plane tournament, but in the knitting ball one, I got a lot of prizes and it made me feel more encouraged to try. This game is great but definitely needs more to attract more and lose less people.",It‚Äôs a good way to make people play the game.,4,True,general,positive,5

I mean, it doesn‚Äôt even have a part where you can ask for people to watch you do a visual! I also feel like since people can lie about their age, and it isn‚Äôt fair to us as kids to let older people be able to say what they want when it seems like they do the most cursing, maybe people can report others that cuss so they would have to use the quick chat for a month or so, since another problem is that it only stops the kids from cursing and explicit stuff, they can still see what other people do if they don‚Äôt have censor chat on. As a result of this, in addition to the above suggestion, make it so that the quick chat is an option available, not an unfamiliar thing forced upon us kids. It really takes something away from the game when most of the people are stuck to a few sentences that doesn‚Äôt even include some vital stuff to the game, as mentioned before with the inability to ask for people to see them do a visual task.

Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.  The little side quests like trophy challenges and the parrot gifts are super helpful. However I will say sometimes you are gifted 30 min unlimited game play and you don‚Äôt really have an option of when to use it. So if I am getting in a quick game on a break or before dinner and I am gifted one of those it goes to waste if I can‚Äôt continue to play for an extra 30 min.  Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.  That being said if you can play and not get frustrated when you get stuck on a level for days, or are willing to pay for buy ups this game rocks.",Just an interesting spin to make the game a little more addictive.,4,True,enjoyability,positive,4

I played MCPE one time for a couple minutes on a friends tablet almost 6 years ago and I‚Äôve been hooked ever since.

I‚Äôm so happy you re-added them with the nether update. I look forward to more updates like the nether update, although not any that are too massive, because people like me (and there are a lot of us) don‚Äôt want to lose the simplicity of Minecraft we grew up with. We all want improvements (bug fixes and Java parity specifically on this version) but we don‚Äôt massive changes that make Minecraft unrecognizable. For example, the cave update everyone wants, every one expects a massive change but don‚Äôt realize it would completely strip Minecraft if it‚Äôs simple mining aspect. I am probably the only person in the world who doesn‚Äôt want a cave update, but I just don‚Äôt want Minecraft to become something else. I‚Äôm sorry this is so long, and I feel bad if any devs actually read this, but I‚Äôve wanted to get this off my chest for a while. Please don‚Äôt strip Minecraft‚Äôs simplicity from it.

It is very entertaining and sometimes I spend hours in a day playing it. The levels seem to get really difficult after you start renovating the third room. I really find it so frustrating that we have to wait 30 minutes for each life to come back. Also, the amount of moves given in each level is ridiculous. Sometimes, you need just 2 more moves to pass the level and you can‚Äôt because you‚Äôre out of moves. Then, if you want more, you have to pay 900 coins for only five more moves. And if you don‚Äôt have the money, you have to forfeit and loose the game. Other times, you can join competitions and get really cool power ups. If I get stuck on one of the levels in the challenges, I loose all my prizes and earned money. The point of the game is to be fun and decorate a house, which honestly is my favorite part of the game. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, the matching part of the game is so fun too, I just hate the fact that you have to wait so long to get lives and some of the tasks they ask you to do are just ridiculous. As an example, if I got a cat in the game, it says I need to give a star just to name it. I mean that‚Äôs ridiculous.

Why do u I have to play 9 games just to hang pictures?? Games such as Homescape, matching mansions, gardenscape etc...all have a visual that your job is to figure out how to fix the room. Putting ppl under the assumption that that‚Äôs all they have to do with some games involved. It‚Äôs misleading to give this impression when in fact you are basically candy crushing it out and spending little time ‚Äúfixing things‚Äù and more time playing so that u can fix things. There‚Äôs a story line yes, but honestly the stories end quicker than u can finish a level. Homescape is still a good game. Matching mansions is good and requires less stars to complete tasks.

To add on to that point, they should have some sort of button to press when you have to go and you are in the middle of a run, so when you have to go, you press the button and it saves the run so you can go back into the game another time. I also think that this games characters are a little over priced.  But that‚Äôs all I have to say on the negative side of things.

This game takes the struggle out of someone having to be banker. A game dragging on for 10+hrs and people are always online playing. There were a few kinks with it in the beginning. But I am seeing that they are fixing it now. I am only giving it 4 stars because as of late a lot of the games I have been in the middle of playing will just not be able to resume. It will be someone else‚Äôs turn and they just never come out of their turn. I think their should be a time limit once they have handled they business. Otherwise you have to wait until they ‚Äúend turn‚Äù & this creates problems in the game. My games were all lost and needed to be exited after this occurred and all that I worked for or played for was lost. This creates a waste of time. Which is pretty unfortunate but other than that this game is extremely fun. I purchased both the other boards the snow and the 1930‚Äôs board I love all of them. Wish the tokens were a bit cheaper and more options. Overall few bug fixes and this game is going to remain my favorite.

All was going well at first. A little lag but I could blame that on my internet. Then, about an hour in our play my game disconnected me. No big deal, it‚Äôs something that can happen sometimes and I can just join right back in. But after 5 minutes it did it again. Then again. And again. Keep in mind I was sitting right next to my router and had all my bars and yet the game kept booting me from the server. I bounced the internet twice and still came out with the same results. Sometimes I would close the entire game and reopen it only to find that the world wouldn‚Äôt even pop up. We were stuck in this complicated dance for over an hour before we decided to call it quits out of utter frustration. There is no way this could just be my internet. Not only was I mere inches away from the router but I was the only one in my house. Nobody else was connected to the internet but me so why did I keep getting booted out of the server? I don‚Äôt appreciate having to pay $7 for a game I can‚Äôt even play. I tried everything and nothing seemed to work.

My game crashes every few minutes, and upon loading the world again it deletes things. There was no need to change the villages' appearances, as they were what made Minecraft, well.. Minecraft. The game doesn't feel the same after the update, and to any new players, I would no longer recommend it. I've played this game for 7 years now, and I've never been this disappointed. A friend of mine can no longer even load the game to play our world together. It's upsetting. It's truly upsetting. The game lags and my world's so corrupted entire chunks glitch out. I don't like it anymore. And no company should ever send out an update that they know has problems they have to acknowledge in the update notice. That's just uncalled for. I'm really upset with the direction the game's going and a lot of people are claiming to be having these problems. I don't want my world to be messed up forever. I don't want to lose this game, but I can not only bear to stand to play it, I literally can't keep it open with this update. Get it together. I miss Minecraft being Minecraft and this update's ruined everything. I don't want anyone else to be as disappointed as I am. With the amount of kids that play this game, they don't deserve it.

The game is fun and requires lots of skill or just fast fingers. My only problems are the prices of some of the items. For the characters I think they can get a little bit pricey. When you get a mystery box it can give you items that help you unlock characters. I honestly think that it might take a month or almost a year to reach the amount because I‚Äôm not joking, they are really pricey. Unless you playing it nonstop without taking your eyes off the screen then it might take a few weeks. But that‚Äôs still a while. Also the hover boards. They can also get a little pricey. And why buy something that you can only use in certain times. It makes it worse that they can get really expensive. Honestly I think their pretty cool but please lower the prices. The last thing you might need to fix is the add lag. Sometimes it will start freezing up and you have to restart the app and that‚Äôs a little annoying in my opinion. I also think that you should only have to face adds if your getting something for free. Other than those issues I truly love the game!

Every time an add plays in the game, it always makes my character crash into one of the train carts. This is a problem that must be fixed or no one will want to play it. I do not recall anyone who has this problem that I know, but that is because most of my friends do not play Subway surfers. There is also a problem with the new ‚Äútankbot‚Äù. I purchased him a day ago and it was a waste of my time and money. It took me forever to purchase this character because it said ‚Äúloading‚Äù. But it took me about 10 minutes to get this character and use it for the first time because of this purchase. Tank bot also crashed every time and my phone froze completely. When it unfroze and I played again, it happened again. I do not remember this happening when I use Zoey or any of the other characters. Please fix that and if you do, I will give a better review.

The game‚Äôs really fun but there is some stupidity to it like tasks cost so much, but u only get one star for each level, and for every normal level, 50 coins. But if you want more moves after you use them all up, it costs 900 coins. I think that is way too expensive. And I hate how long it takes for lives to refill! Like, 30 minutes to wait for one live! Also, for the harder levels, I think that we should get more stars, not only one!! I think that if they‚Äôre going to go all the way and say that it‚Äôs a ‚Äúsuper hard level‚Äù then they should act like it and give more stars once the level is completed!!

But I pay for the fastest fiber optics network around, and even with that connection I can't normally make it through an online game. Every time I try it freezes at some point and I can't continue playing. For a game you have to pay $4 just to play normally, I really think that's a factor that needs to be addressed. But Pass and Play is a fun way to pass time when you're traveling with someone or are waiting on an appointment, and playing the AI can still be a fun experience as well.

It is just like the old monopoly I used to play except way faster because the money was automatically transferred. I do have some complaints though.

If you spam click a property you want to mortgage then you lose money until you can‚Äôt click it anymore. When you are paying someone money it will do the transfer animation with the monopoly dollars but it will do the same animation no matter how much money was given/lost. The dice. I am slightly annoyed when they land on a flat surface when it should be landing on top of the buildings. It would be cool if the dice Didn't land on the buildings as if they were drawn onto the board. If they landed on top of the buildings that would be cool. These are just minor issues that I would be fine if they didn‚Äôt change.

Now multiplayer is fun and all especially when I‚Äôm winning cuz I‚Äôll have a few thousand and a row of hotels that bankrupt two other players. But then it‚Äôs always fun to just flash my wealth around and buy properties from the last player just so that it‚Äôs harder for them, but every time I do this (or just if I trade properties for money in general when someone‚Äôs bankrupt) it gets me stuck on the keep property mortgaged page. So I click unmorggage. Then I click it again. Then five minutes later I‚Äôm still spam clicking the button and I have to leave to solve the problem. I‚Äôve tried everything I could but it always does this. Monopoly‚Äôs a great game and all but honestly I‚Äôll probably just delete the game because it‚Äôs just annoying and frustrating when I have a hotel on boardwalk, all the railroads, and like 10 other hotels, while the other player has two properties left unmortgaged, then they win because the lousy game crashes on me.

The imposter‚Äôs job is to sabotage, kill and lie. However almost everyone play with ‚ÄúConfirm Ejects‚Äù and ‚ÄúVisual Tasks‚Äù on. Confirm ejects means that when someone is voted out it says ‚Äú(insert anything here) was not An Imposter‚Äù or ‚Äúwas An Imposter‚Äù. With it being the imposter‚Äôs job to lie, this feature makes it ridiculously harder for the imposter to win and makes the game unfair. Visual tasks are tasks that some people can watch and confirm you are a crewmate. If you have these on with confirm ejects, you can almost guarantee a crewmate win. These features make this game incredibly unfair and should not be a thing. If you get offended by swear words, DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!! This game is ruled by immature 12 year olds and when they get accused, they break lose. I am not exaggerating, I have heard the N word, the F word, and so many other ridiculously bad and racist words in this game than I did in the real world. The N word is a word that you will encounter. People think it‚Äôs okay if they leave the hard r out but it‚Äôs not. The N word is probably the most popular word in this game.

It‚Äôs pretty hard to find a game where no one is constantly cussing inappropriate things in the chat, which ruins the game for everyone! On the other hand, there are some ridiculous hashtags marked on a word that isn‚Äôt even bad! Some people also put very disgusting things as their names.

This has been happening on every single one of my survival worlds. Maybe because it has Smite 1 on the golden pickaxe but if so why would you give that out to people? I stumbled across a village and went to go see if they had a furnace so I didn‚Äôt have to make one. Halfway through making cooking something in the Blast Furnace it just completely stopped. I tried taking everything out and putting them back in but no. I was really annoyed because I needed to cook food! Since it wasn‚Äôt working I decided to make a regular furnace. Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô? I didn‚Äôt even know that existed in the game! A lot other glitches have been happening I just can‚Äôt think of all of them right now. Those glitches stood out to me the most. Overall really good game!,Checked the crafting recipe and it wanted a different block than cobble it wanted ‚ÄòBlackstone‚Äô?,5,True,general,positive,5

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time. If you are reading this and are from inner sloth, then hopefully you will consider doing something to revive among us.","Ok, so among used to be the worlds most popular game.",2,True,enjoyability,positive,4

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

This app appears to be too similar to Candy Crush. But it has different things to do. And this is also having similar power ups.

The only time something really weird happened was when somebody with a weird name had tried to get us to follow his/her Twitter, but thanks to the new update Among Us blocks your ability to redirect to another website in the chat. Here‚Äôs the thing though. Recently, I ran into another one of the weird-named people, and they said in the chat that the lobby was hacked and he/she had all of the players‚Äô IP addresses. This was an empty threat, as IP addresses are public knowledge (and you can‚Äôt find out where you are based on them)and Apple phones are virtually impossible to hack. However, this really shook me up and I deleted Among Us immediately. I didn‚Äôt want to be hacked. EVER. It was kind of scary even though I knew the extensive anti-hacking measures taken place by InnerSloth (the game‚Äôs creator). While this game is fun, it‚Äôs not worth it being scared every time my friends aren‚Äôt up for a game. If you are getting this for a group of friends/family, then you are fine.

Right before he was killed he had just made a baby with my friends dog, Morgan, they had already had baby earlier on named April. I wanted another one, and decided to breed them again. A few seconds after that Buddy (My wolf) was killed. It was devastating. We named the baby after Buddy, Buddy Jr., it would just be so convenient for us both to control him. Considering we are his aunts. But Buddy Jr. mostly has to stay with his dad, Morgan, because he needs to live with his dad. Anyways my point is please make it where people can control other dogs. My third request is that you guys add slabs that are vertical. Everyone‚Äôs been asking for these, and it would be very useful, and helpful. Also if you could make it where villagers, foxes, and mobs can be leashed. That‚Äôs all my requests for now.

This is fun, too, but you have to be prepared for some disappointment. Currently, there are bugs that prevent games from being finished, and these bugs can happen after you‚Äôve played for 30 minutes or more. For example, if somebody owes money, and they try to make another deal to raise more money, this seems to stop the game. It seems to lose track of whose turn it is (and who is still owed money). Sometimes, if someone refuses all your deals for that turn, it ends your turn for some reason, but the End Turn button is still shown. Pressing End Turn at this point stops the game. If you are low on battery life and get a battery warning, it can disconnect you from the game.

However, the game is hard to play on my own time. The game really only works when it wants to. Some are do to bugs, and some are due to just poor design. 1) Game will not load when you go offline still logged into Xbox. It will not let you sign out, and the game crashes repeatedly. I have not found a way to fix this, because even when I try to enable cellular data, it still will not load because no changes in settings are saved before the game crashes. This is extremely inconvenient when I just want to play single player offline. This bug has been going on for months and is consistently overlooked. Please fix this immediately. It discourages players from even attempting to load up their worlds, which ultimately hurts the developers.2) Background music stops when Minecraft is launched. If you are listening to Spotify/Pandora, etc, then the game automatically cuts off your music when you listen to the game. If people didn‚Äôt pause their music before entering the game, then obviously, they want to listen to it while the play! This was definitely programmed in, for reasons I can‚Äôt even begin to comprehend. Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.","Please remove this feature, as it is just annoying, especially when constantly trying to reload your game due to the bug mentioned above.",3,True,reliability,negative,7

It drains the battery so quickly.  It freezes up which forces you to close it and open it again.  The trades the A.I. players make are ridiculous and play after play they repeat over and over even if you silence them for that turn.  Real players wouldn‚Äôt do half of this stuff   Sometimes it appears that the dice roll is not random.  Sometimes the chance or community chest cards can be the same thing on back to back draws. Who goes first, second, third is flawed because it depends upon how you are listed and who rolls the highest dice when playing against the A.I players.   Not as much animation is needed which may help the battery drain or at least give an option to turn some of that off. So many things in each turn slow the whole game down and could be altered to keep it moving. Why not put the property cards displaying in the lower right rather than taking up the whole screen.

Not going to lie, at those moments It really is frustrating because you get only 5 lives and the regeneration rate is slow. In addition the buy rate for items feels a little high. As an example to buy an extra 5 moves at the end of a tough level is 900 coins. You maybe get 55 coins for beating a level. So you have to tear through 18 levels to earn enough to buy that extension.  It actually de-incentivizes me to buy a package because it never really feels like you are getting a deal.

It has usual free play features like picking tasks and being the impostor. But with one major difference: the AI is more intelligent. I‚Äôll give you a look at both sides of this mode. CREWMATE VIEW:You run around doing tasks with the other AI crew mates. And one of the crew mates is the impostor. The impostor‚Äôs AI does intelligent stuff like: trapping you in rooms, sabotaging electricity and such, and so much more! IMPOSTOR VIEW:The crew mates are doing tasks. While your the impostor. You take down the AI crew mates and such. But the AI crew mates does intelligent things like the AI impostor. Like:Reporting dead bodies, calling emergency meetings, and so much more! I would love to see all of this added into free play mode. I will be awaiting your response.EDIT:Ok, I think a great feature to have would be when the impostor kills you and your pet cries, you can comfort it. Like pet it and tell it everything is gonna be okay. Then it‚Äôs happy and it starts following your ghost. I would love this feature. Once again, I will be awaiting your response.‚ÄîYour biggest fan",It‚Äôs so fun!,5,True,enjoyability,positive,4

Don‚Äôt get me wrong they‚Äôre great characters, but bumping down the price a little wouldn‚Äôt hurt. The second suggestion is offering more discounts on things like coins and prize boxes in the game. Maybe you could even call it Discount Day or Discount Week. The last suggestion is putting more missions in the game. Like for example, having the game players find LIMITED EDITION Gold boxes along the trail, that are filled with SUPER RARE things like unlocking special characters or getting a BIG amount of gems or coins. Other than these few suggestions, this game is amazingly fun! I like how it travels around the world to a new location every other month, and has characters that you buy from that specific location to go along with the theme!

Idk why they had to change the engine they were on but it made the game buggy and unresponsive at times. Before this update, I could honestly say the game was perfect. I had 0 issues. The hoverboard mechanic was very responsive even at the higher speed late game. The physics were doing great for a game, but now the hoverboard lags at times, I was in a super late game run where I attempted to activate the hoverboard and it didn‚Äôt work until my 4th attempt at double tapping. This wouldn‚Äôt have been an issue in the previous update. Also, the roofs can end your game even with a hoverboard? I have the monster board with the high jump ability and I made it admittedly higher than expected, but I just expected to lose the board and continue, but no it killed me entirely. The previous update where I did the same just passed me through no worries. If this is for added difficulty, I guess I can understand, but the fluidity the game once had is gone.

Also look at all of the reviews your getting. People aren‚Äôt happy and your star level is dropping. I‚Äôll let that speak for itself. Just change the game back or tweak the update please.

I personally was over the top crazy for it and loved it, but it‚Äôs now dead for many reasons. One reason is hackers and cheaters. More mods are being used and hacking and cheating is getting more popular. Some times, I can‚Äôt play one game without a hacker or cheater. Multiple people play together and say who is the imposter and some hackers are being able to kill in the middle of meetings and do visuals as imposter. Another reason is that there are no new maps. Among us said that the new airship would come out in early December 2020, but they delayed it and said early 2021. Everyone thought it would come out in January or February, but it‚Äôs March and it still hasn‚Äôt come out yet. Another reason is that the new chat update can‚Äôt let you talk freely. Now you spend all of  your meeting time searching around for the prewritten text that you want to say. Another reason is the horrible connection. Some times, I have to spend like 20 minutes trying to connect my game. People say it‚Äôs my bad wifi, but that‚Äôs not true because my wifi works perfectly fine. The last reason is that some people change settings so that either the crew or the imposters have an almost certain win. If you are reading this long review, then I thank you for your time.

So I saw these worlds you could download that already have houses in them and i thought it would be fun. For example: City Life. It looked really fun to play because you can ride in cars and there are a lot of different buildings you can go in. So it said I could buy it for $5.99 and I did, I played on it with my sisters for hours. I really liked it. This went on for a couple of weeks, but then one day it said it was locked and I had to buy City Life all over again, i was very mad. I already changed stuff in that world and I didn‚Äôt even know that If i rebought it, all my stuff would still be there. I was willing to rebuy because I thought it wouldn‚Äôt happen again and it was just an error Minecraft made. I played on it for an hour or two and I turned it off and didn‚Äôt touch it. The next day, I was excited to play on City Life again, but this time I was furious. It had been only 14 hours and it‚Äôs already saying I have to rebuy it again.

Each update is better then the last, adding amazing animals and new objects. However I have noticed in the recent update, TONS of new bugs and issues have occurred. Such as, sometimes when I am crafting something, I craft it and then go back in the crafting table. But my item is still there. I try to remove it, but it just replaces itself with another one. I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze. One more is, sometimes when I go into the nether, it stays frozen on the ‚Äúloading terrain‚Äù screen. Other than these glitches and bugs, I HIGHLY recommend this game. Whenever I want to play a fun game, this will always be my first choice. With the endless building ideas, the challenge of defeating the bosses, and playing countless games and tests Minecraft is the best game out there and will make you play for hours.

I did the same thingwith the age thing, and it didn‚Äôt give me a choice for the chat. So communication is getting very hard for me, as I heard the same from others before this. So my point is just because of that, makes the game a lot harder and less fun. I sometimes have conversations in the lobby, and it‚Äôs fun, but without that humor expressed or something that sounds like your own words makes the game less fun and sound like a bot. And then some of us would rather play Roblox, Minecraft, GTA, that sort of stuff instead.

Why it‚Äôs A annoying. This update makes it hard to type and this so called safe environment is dum. If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one. If this does not work then they can play with friends or uninstall the game. Another thing is that it feels like you ‚Äú the among us savers ‚Äú are taking away freedom of speech. How?    If someone can‚Äôt say what they want to say about this or that it feels like you censored who that person,thing,or whatever is. However you might say this ‚Äúwell we also have it we‚Äôre if your 18 plus (example for age) you can say what you want to say ‚Äú and your right but but but most people that play this game are under 18 plus as of myself. So these people who have to deal with this new way of ‚Äúspeech‚Äù would most likely not like this but then again I‚Äôm not them. If you feel like I‚Äôm wrong then I‚Äôm wrong if you feel like I‚Äôm right then I‚Äôm right but I‚Äôm just shooting out there that this ‚Äúupdate‚Äù might or should I say will effect this games success in a good way or bad way and if it does effect it in a bad way then at least you would know why. Thank you for reading this and I love the among us community and the people in it and the game I‚Äôm just hoping you would listen to what I have to say thank you and good bye.",If a player feels like they are getting attacked then they just leave the game and join a new one.,1,True,learnability,positive,6

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.

Minecraft is one of the best games out there at least for me it is. I basically grew up playing it on my xbox 360. Nothing wrong with the gameplay or anything. But I do have one complaint. Now i‚Äôm not entirely sure if this a bug or a glitch so it might be nothing but it bothers me. So basically I play on the server: MineVille City. And when i go into one the minigames, that minigame being High-School Roleplay there are problems with my custom skin. So idk if this has to do with the server but this has happened most of the time. I walk around and when i pull up the pause menu my custom skin is replaced with a random skin. And I sometimes see other players with my skin equipped. And idk if my skin is working or not. Even when i do the inventory menu my custom skin is still there. So Mojang, if you see this then please reach out to me. My Minecraft account is a Xbox live account named Endermen21YT. So please if you can, look into this. Now this could totally just be the server or something else so this might not even be happening. I‚Äôve even noticed that this has happened to other ppl before on those servers. And it only happens when I enter the minigame. In the main server my skin‚Äôs fine. So anyway yeah that‚Äôs all.

I‚Äôd like to be able to use 100 coins for each move I want to add. I might only use one more move to win and I just wasted 900 coins or it takes me 6 moves but to up the ante a second time costs another 1200 coins. How often do people use the 2100 coins for an extra 10 moves and if they do, did it take them another 5 moves to win or just 1? Let us dish out 100 coins at a time or buy more bombs or something. Love building the house with the wins but start a new day? Really? That‚Äôs usually like mid-day or something when it comes up and it might take me 5 days to win the two levels to start a new day.

Just when I thought I was finished in the garden, the story line STILL has more garden tasks. I really want to see more of the mansion!

I'm on level 454 and have only renovated the butlers room, great room, kitchen, and stairs! Maybe the creators of the game could give players a choice on which room or area to continue with?

However, I would really like to see some better incentives to keep players in the game. For some of the side challenges (e.g. knitting), the rewards, such as unlimited lives for a certain period of time, are given immediately. If I had the option to save that reward for a rainy day, perhaps when I‚Äôm tackling a particularly difficult level, I‚Äôd be more inclined to play for longer periods of time. When this happens, however, it‚Äôs almost always the case that I don‚Äôt have the time to actually use said reward and it ends up being useless. I‚Äôd also like to see the coin rewards have a better balance. 50-70 coins as a reward for each level won? Come on! What about an additional ten or so coins for each remaining turn? Say if I‚Äôve beaten a level and I have five turns left. I should win the base coins of fifty and then an additional fifty for each turn I didn‚Äôt use. For harder levels, base coins of 100 and then an additional fifty coins for each additional remaining turn. Now THAT‚ÄôS an incentive! That would be rad.

Another is that tapping anywhere near the bottom right when trying to select one of your own properties causes the game to think you tapped the ‚Äúend turn‚Äù button, screwing up your turn. Another horrible gameplay thing is the fact that AI players constantly choose ‚Äúauction‚Äù instead of buying properties outright, which is not at all like how people in real life play the game.

For example, every task around the house goes from costing one star to two. The rewards aren‚Äôt sufficient to the amount of boosts being spent on harder levels. Some levels are so hard and waste so many lives that you have to use boosts just to get through it. There should be more levels that don‚Äôt take multiple tries to get through. Some of the tasks that the game makes you do are stupid. The game is trying to get you to use all your stars so you have to play more, which is typical, but with the levels so hard, it‚Äôs really just a tactic to get people to spend more money. It‚Äôs also takes way too long for the lives to reload. It‚Äôs like 25mins per life. I really liked this game at the start but the further I‚Äôve gotten, the less I want to continue playing. Instead of throwing in so many different aspects into the puzzle games so soon, they should have waited and made it harder much later. I‚Äôm only in the kitchen and I spend on average 3-5 lives on each level. I try not to use boosters because they are so hard to earn. Paying 900coins to get 5 more moves on one level, when each level earns you roughly 50-70 coins (hard levels earn you 100+) is just sad.

The only down side about the game is he hover boards and the characters are all SO MANY coins and keys. I am never able to get that many coins and keys. I just try to get enough coins to get the character Lucy, and her scary outfit or whatever it is called. Then I just play the game and like a month later I will try to see how much I can pay for.

And I see many many others have complained of the same thing. Wish I read reviews before I installed and got hooked.

I end having to close the app and reopen it. Another problem that has recently developed is, whenever I go into chat when I am on a sever, my game immediately freezes, then crashes and knocks me out of the app. Another thing that has recently happened is when I am playing and go into my inventory, it freezes and won‚Äôt unfreeze.

There should be a way to kick people faster if you‚Äôre the host during a game. Some people like to call emergency meetings and waste time, so being able to kick them out would make it go by way faster. 2. I think it would be awesome to add a send a friend request button. Some people have really good friendships on here and a lot of the time one of them might disconnect or have to go and never see each other again! ;( If we had a add friend button, we could always play with them. Plus, when you try to give your personal number or social media‚Äôs out to someone, the whole server can see it unless you ban them all. 3. I think I saw this on another review, but maybe add a limit to camera time? It‚Äôs kinda hard to kill when people are guarding the cameras. 4.

The problem is you have to get stars from playing one game only. And even on a hard level you still get 1 star. It‚Äôs annoying how fast your stars run out. What‚Äôs even more annoying, it‚Äôs that sometimes you have to give one of your stars just to open a box, that you‚Äôve already given a star for box to get to the house! What I‚Äôm saying is give more chances to get stars. Like as a prize. Instead of just money, give us a little money and a star! Or have different games besides just the one game to match the colors.     Another thing is that it takes so long to complete one floor or one area of the house because of how limited of the stars you have. So I suppose you should just focus on the star problem because it will fix this one of taking so long! üòÜ     Please take this into consideration.

Then it kicks me out and says ‚ÄúThis server is full‚Äù I know you probably cannot stop this from happening. But I have no one else to talk to so I only have you guys.Update: Oh! And I forgot, sometimes people make servers and people join, only to get kicked or blocked by the host. I don‚Äôt understand why people do this. What do they get out of it you ask? Nothing. Can you please make a limit of how many people you can kick? Or perhaps rules I am sincerely sorry if this problem has been fixed. But I haven‚Äôt seen it with my own eyes happen to ME, but I‚Äôve seen it happen to others.Update: I‚Äôve now discovered that the ‚ÄúAutomatic role‚Äù system is very bad for me. I‚Äôve gotten Crewmate almost all of the time. Now it‚Äôs rare if I even get imposter ONCE. I try every single day. But now it‚Äôs a very boring app for me since all I get is Crewmate and always get killed first, then have to deal with dumb people who see the body but just stand by it without reporting, then another person comes in and thinks it that person since they‚Äôre standing near the body.","But one thing that bugs me is that; After a round an ad plays, right?",5,True,reliability,negative,7

I would really like being able to use emojis in game because I ( my opinion ) REALLYYYY like to express my feelings with emojis. I‚Äôm not sure if most people agree why we should add emojis but I‚Äôm pretty sure a few of us want emojis. üòâ The second thing is friending each other.

Sometimes I see a person vent... but before I can hit the Emergency Meeting button, they kill me. I get quite annoyed because I‚Äôm usually the person who ends up being the last crewmate. So, I also lose the game and not really angry but kind of annoyed! I feel bad saying this just so you know üôÉ. Those are all my suggestions! Hope a few of them get added!!!!!!

It helps the time go by quickly.  The only thing that bothers me is the hard and extra hard part of the game.  I realize that it breaks up the monotony, but, I spend days sometimes trying to beat the level.  But, it is good that the hard and extra hard are few and far between, so it‚Äôs not overwhelming, it‚Äôs a good change of pace. And, as others have said, rewards are few and far between as well.  Especially with the hard levels, the rewards are just this: your normal level low coin reward is doubled and you are rewarded with one extra star.  I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.  There is a reason we play games that say that they are free, it‚Äôs because a lot of us do not have the funds to use actual money to progress farther in the game faster then the other players that can afford to use their hard earned money.  In conclusion, I think this game is well worth 5 stars, however, I did only give it 4 stars on account of the hard and very hard levels & the lack of well deserved rewards.  I think there should be better rewards and it should be a little easier to get stars.  Just my opinion for what it‚Äôs worth.  But, great game!","I know you have to make money in this venture, but, your doing it to the detriment of your customers.",4,True,cost,negative,1

When you join ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù, and you‚Äôre playing, you can leave the app and come back however long later, and the game would continue from where you left off. This is the first evidence of AI in an online supposed real person mode. The second bit of evidence is that the AI trades at very specific rates: when you‚Äôre paying cash for a property, they want double the property price. If you offer too much lower than double, they‚Äôll permanently reject the offer. Closer to double, and they‚Äôll counter for double. Third bit of evidence is when they offer you a trade, and you decline. If they offered money, they‚Äôll make another offer increasing their offer by 10$. Decline again, they‚Äôll increase by 10$ again. And so on. Another issue is that on Multiplayer with friends, if you accidentally leave the app, you‚Äôre instantly replaced with an AI and there‚Äôs no way for you to rejoin. This makes your phone unusable other than to play the game if you don‚Äôt want to erase all the progress you‚Äôve just made on a match with a friend. Please look into this. TLDR: ‚ÄúOnline Multiplayer‚Äù isn‚Äôt online multiplayer. There may be one or two ‚Äúreal‚Äù people in every game of 4, but never a full game of 4 real people.
