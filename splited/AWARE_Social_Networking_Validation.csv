After the call integration update,- I drop calls more easily due to it being difficult to navigate outside of the app whilst staying in call. - I have a hard time returning to discord using the “touch to return to call” banner because it takes me to the actual iPhone call screen which just says “Discord Audio Connecting...” even if I’m already in call. - If i get another call on my iPhone, it kicks me out of the discord call (I was able to stay in the call before) and it’s difficult to get back in. Furthermore, if my phone call is longer than five minutes, the user I’m in call with gets kicked out as a result of me being kicked out of the call. Additionally, In an older update the “iPhone/Speaker” function for choosing if you want your call on speaker or just to be normal volume. Even if I turn my volume all the way down on my phone, it’s so loud that everyone around me can hear because it’s just on speaker by default and I can no longer change it. Really unfortunate and forces me to use some other method to contact people when I am in public. Discord is my favorite social media app to use both on pc and mobile and the downsliding of the quality on mobile is just very frustrating and disappointing.

The same chosen virtual numbers, call history and messages, number of credits purchased, and the same userID, which the derive from the parting of the email address before @.

Extremely useful is you happen to be away from Wi-Fi)    It pays for U.S. calls with ads, but you can block all adds on iPhone/iPad (not just in Safari) with AdGuard, Adblocker Mobile and number of others2. Dingtone and and TalkU (also from the same developer, but features are different and they work independently).3.

They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here.

Also, I really want the GIFs to have their own spot so you don’t need to go to Photos and Videos and then click GIFs. Also, make a DRAWING option. Well, that’s all.

One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone. This is an issue with maybe privacy, but also while you’re using the app. Since calls are so spammable in DMs or Group DMs, the call screen will appear on your phone and disappear rapidly. While on the calling screen, you cannot do anything other than accept or decline the call. This is an issue because that basically makes it so if someone spam calls you, you can’t do anything until they stop. If you go to block them, it will take much too long. Other than this issue, the developers are pretty good about fixing bugs within the app. Also, if I’m listening to music when I join a call and then leave, my music will have messed up audio after.","One of the more recent updates, however, made it so when someone called you through the app, it would act as a phone call on your phone.",4,True,general,phone call,112.0,122.0,positive,4

This is a very desired feature for writers and professional chats. Messages can show they were “edited” or even show edit history if it’s a concern. But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis.

Night Mode - a setting with black chat bubbles and white font, black background, and dulled colors for use at night. This is so essential.2. Editing - allow users to edit messages. This is a very desired feature for writers and professional chats. Messages can show they were “edited” or even show edit history if it’s a concern. But having the option to fix typos and misspellings is so key.3. Chat color choices - offer more than just light green bubble choices. Offer a wide range of colors (including gradients) as a fun feature that allows for customization. 4. Reactions - allow a set of reactions to messages including heart, thumbs up and down, and possibly some basic emojis. This makes communication much more efficient.I hope the developers will seriously consider adding all of these features! It would make WhatsApp the perfect messaging app.","There are no perfect messaging services, but I believe WhatsApp could be perfect if they added just a few key features:

However, there are some things that I think could be tweaked. So I want to start off by addressing the calls. Everything is fine except the speaker. The only time I can use speaker is when the camera is on, meaning I have to have the camera flipping another way to have the person I’m chatting with not see me. If there could be a speaker button for when you’re calling someone without headphones, that’ll be great. The only other thing I can think of, that I’m really hoping gets fixed, is the emotes for group chat. My friends have no problem using it with their phones, but when it comes to iPhones, if I click emojis, they don’t appear. The only way to make it appear is to type out the name. For example, we have an emote of a cat named henk, so when I would want to use it, I’d have to type :henk:. Now we have a lot of emotes and it’s difficult to remember the name of every single one. If there could be a way for iPhone users to use their emotes without having to type it out, it’ll be nice. If there could also be a way for phone users to create emotes through their phones instead of uploading it to their computer that’ll make things a bit more simple.

The reason why is that I was in a large public group, and a spammer joined an started posting porn. This was auto-downloaded, added to my photo library, and then auto-transferred to another photo library. As a result, a spammer ended up adding a bunch of porn to my photo library, which was then uploaded to a second backup, and almost ended up with it uploaded to social media. I had to spend hours clearing multiple libraries of this crap, and I still cannot be 100% sure I got everything. To be clear, I want to be able to see images that the group posts, and I want to be able to download and add them AT WILL.

It was bad before, it’s worse now. There is still no support for any functionality with earbud button interaction like a mute toggle or end-call. AttenuationThis “feature” has never been satisfactory on this app. Currently, attenuation is maxed (5% volume) and held there as long as the app is running. Even if you mute volume in Discord, sound reduction exists. It is clearly NOT attenuation but rather full volume limitation of other apps.Top BarThe Discord app keeps a notification bar active full time and it is “always on top” therefore getting in the way. A great example is the fact that I almost forgot to add this complaint, but the bar was in the way of the “send” button to post the review. Phone-calls crash appThe worst thing about this app is when it crashes when you get a call. Note that it crashed when you receive the call, even if you don’t answer the it. The app must be shut down and restarted manually every time you get a call. Unacceptable.

But the mobile version is missing quite a few important features. For example, Discord on mobile (possibly IOS only) doesn't have Audit Logs for server moderation. Audit Logs are very important for server moderation, so that is one flaw with the mobile app. Also, only a minor setback this is, is the fact that there is no emote button on the mobile app. Yes, you can easily tap the emoji button on your keyboard, but if you are in a server with global emotes, you have to type out the names of the emote. But, there is emote prediction, making this a minor set back. Finally, I want to mention this weird bug that happens sometimes; It is a bug when you can't join Voice Channels or Voice Calls; it just disconnects you automatically, and it does this for a loop. When you close the app and retry, the same results will happen. You usually have to wait hours before you can join a Voice Channel or Voice Call again. Thank you for making such a wonderful app!

And it’s not because the employees and staff working at discord are mean, or anything, it’s because of the nature of the setup discord chooses to use. Essentially when you join a server, the guidelines you have are the ones the owner sets for you. Larger servers are often governed by mods. But the problem is that these mods generally don’t have too many qualifications to be a moderator. And when the mods are ineffective at creating a safe environment, that’s when toxic behavior thrives. Discord does have some policies, on its ToS but these are generally very simple rules, and are few and far between. I’ve had many terrible experiences on servers where toxic behavior is present and the mods either do nothing about it or they take the wrong course of action. Now this isn’t something discord has much control over, but rather design of the website in it’s entirety is flawed. I wouldn’t recommend this app to people who who are not in a healthy state of mind, or to anyone in general.

As I’m sure is obvious, when I do several of these posts an hour the process of copying and pasting fragments of the messages becomes tedious. Not something that I generally hate, because with how wonderful discord servers are, allowing for many channels to be set up in ways that allow role-play servers to set up several settings, the limited characters per message is far outweighed in my preference.

Each outgoing message is timestamped -- in a separate screen available after long-clicking a message -- to show when it was sent and when delivered. (There is also a ""when read"" timestamp, but that has no bearing here.) Over the course of the past weeks and months, the timestamps show frequent delivery delays of 20 minutes, 30 minutes, and sometimes even hours. Some messages are never delivered. These frequent long delays defeat the central requirement of a working text message system -- conversations that happen in near real time. It's like having a car with revolutionary safety features that only starts half the time, or stalls for 30 minutes every few trips. It is unacceptable.

It helped me get through a lot of quarantine knowing that I had people to talk to and had a  reason to get up everyday. I could share and discuss different sorts of interests I had like gaming and anime. I could even create my own custom servers where I could toggle around the settings and fixture it to my own liking. There are just so many endless possibilities and opportunities on discord that I don’t think I could get anywhere else so easily and helpfully. I 100% recommend getting discord if you wanna socialize with people just like you or wanna call up some buds to game with.

I just wanna say I love using Discord especially on mobile devices when I don’t have a laptop, and it’s quite a fun app to chat with others.  However, there are some things that I want to have Discord improve on or at least try to help with the app to make it better, especially for mobile devices.  One thing in particular is to have more color choices for roles and to customize role colors on mobile devices.  Another thing is when I see some people’s status when it says something like “Playing Sleeping”, “Playing And 3...2...1..”, etc, I want that option to be available to mobile devices, or if that is already available, please respond to me with how I would do that.  One last thing is when I try to save a picture with a transparent background, when I go look at it in my photos, it doesn’t go from a white background to taping to a black background. I really would like these issues to be fixed in the next update or two.  Other than that, this app is very great and I love how it is improving but by bit!

On Thursday, I was disconnecting and reconnecting out of voice channels very frequently. I didn’t pay much attention to it, thinking it was a one-time thing.The next day, Discord was crashing on me at random, mainly when I was connected to voice channels. That’s when I noticed that some other people in the servers I’m in also were having the same problem, they were tired of being disconnected from voice channels, but there really wasn’t much we could do about it.Yesterday was when I got tired of it. I kept getting disconnected/reconnected and other people’s voices were going robotic due to that, the app kept crashing, and now, I was getting kicked from the voice channels entirely.Today it’s gotten worse, many other people and I have gotten a bug where we can’t hear anything going on in the voice channel. Resetting didn’t do anything, deleting and reinstalling the app only worked once (out of five times) for me, and even then it crashed right after, bringing me back to square one. One of my friends had the same problem, and after reinstalling three times, he still couldn’t get the audio to work. Voice chatting is a major part of Discord, it’s the only form of communication for some. What would be the point in it if it doesn’t work properly?

But after the most recent update, I am now almost completely unable to watch video links even if I'm not in a vc call. They won't load most of the time or actually let me watch it at all, but occasionally I can watch them but then there's no sound, even if I turn the volume up. I'm unaware if it's just an IPhone issue (I have the iPhone 11) or if other phones have this issue too.

The same chosen virtual numbers, call history and messages, number of credits purchased, and the same userID, which the derive from the parting of the email address before @.

Extremely useful is you happen to be away from Wi-Fi)    It pays for U.S. calls with ads, but you can block all adds on iPhone/iPad (not just in Safari) with AdGuard, Adblocker Mobile and number of others2. Dingtone and and TalkU (also from the same developer, but features are different and they work independently).3. TextFree voiceNot to mention Skype, which supports many virtual call out numbers, and you get 60 international minutes free every month, if you pay for $98 for MS Office, plus 1T on OneDriveOr Google HangOuts, just first set up Google Voice and get a virtual number. They charge $20 (I think) for changing the number, so it’s not a “burner number” app, neither are those I have mentioned here.

However, there are some features on PC that you can just not access on mobile.  For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.  Another thing is that you can't change somebody's role on mobile, which is very aggravating. I'm a moderator on a server and we have a specific role to give to misbehaving people which prevents them from sending messages.  But, I can only do my job as moderator if I'm on my PC, because mobile won't let me change roles.  In addition, for whatever reason, certain pictures refuse to upload, and it’s not the channel settings because it’s only with certain pictures (only on mobile).  The last thing I recommend, which is currently neither on mobile or PC, is having some version of read receipts for DMs.  I know that's probably gonna be controversial, but I personally know that some of my friends are big YouTubers, so they get caught up, and forget.  However, if I was able to tell if they'd read my message, I'd be able to yell at — er, uh, talk to them about it.","For example, you can't change privacy settings to turn off DMs on a certain server, which can be a struggle for people with, uh, fans.",4,True,general,server,77.0,83.0,negative,4

Facebook has zero respect for free speech. The only thing worse than Facebook’s “independent fact checkers” is their gross invasion of users privacy. They track your exact location, your website history, and they use the microphone on your phone to record everything that you say. This happens every second your phone is on, regardless of if the app is opened or closed. What do they do with all of this information? They sell it to other companies for a profit, they use it to bombard you with ads that are very specific to you, and God knows what else. Mark Zuckerburg has become filthy rich off of invading the privacy of over 3 billion people and selling off that information. Sucker berg is a Nazi and a totalitarian and should be in prison for his crimes!

I don't know what it is but what is the point of constant updates when clearly it doesn't fix much?A couple years ago there was a list of all these pages for me to like and follow such as movies, tv shows, artists, etc. because Facebook wanted to see what kind of things I like. Like ads, it bombards my page but even more than the ads itself. I click on the page to either ""unlike"" or ""see less of this"" but it puts another page in its place to bombard me all over again. They need to add a setting where it allows users to show less of every page they liked or followed, not just 1.Lastly, I am sick and tired of getting requests sent to me of games I've never heard of by friends and family. Why do I have to constantly go into settings to turn off notifications of a game? The problem is that I can only block the game notifications   AFTER I get them.

However, despite the amazing things the team has done, the mobile is still equivalent to urinating into an anthill.

However at some point, the app stops allowing voice chat the moment I leave and look at memes or other things. And it only begins again when I go back in,Ultimately resulting in me having to restart the app. Second, when using discord, while in a call, the screen will suddenly shut off, but the phone will not and not turn the screen on unless hitting the power button or waiting for brief flashes of the screen. This is increasingly angering as I talk to my friends, trying to share memes, or other things and my screen is refusing to work.

Huge unusable app.,"I kept hoping Facebook would stop switching in app sounds back on and that they would also do away with trying to force me to create a passcode, but the undoing of my preferences by the app has become relentless. I have to switch off the app sounds daily. It’s obnoxious! I never wanted them in the first place. How many times will I have to inform the app that I want the sounds shut off for good? It is unpleasant to hear cheesy clicking and clacking sounds as you simply move from post to post on Facebook. Horrible idea.It’s not only that. This is the largest most bloated battery sucking app there is. It bogs down my phone. What others have said about the updates consuming all of their storage is absolutely true. I wasn’t going to write a negative review even for the constant unnecessary toggling on of the app sounds, but every time there’s an update for this app there is no room for it on my phone. I have almost nothing on my phone. How is this app mobile friendly in any way? It’s a behemoth. I’m going to collect my personal photos and documents from it and delete it. I’ll happily find other places to socialize on the Internet. Sorry.",I’m going to collect my personal photos and documents from it and delete it.,1,True,security,photo,34.0,39.0,positive,7

All of the other free text and call apps are scams and have so many fees and in app purchases:( but this is so dependent! If u google this app it says the numbers are temporary.

I can text my friend fast and easy from a different state! Calling is okay. The reception is kinda not so good, but I found the key! Just turn your volume all the way up and turn on speaker!
